%Supplementing experimental data with molecular simulation results at extreme temperatures and pressures can extend the range  fundamental equations of state for estimating thermodynamic properties over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and densities

Molecular simulation results at extreme temperatures and pressures can be used to supplement experimental data when developing fundamental equations of state for estimating thermodynamic properties over a wide range of state points. Since most force fields are optimized to agree with vapor-liquid equilibria properties, however, the reliability of the molecular simulation results depends on the validity/transferability of the force field at higher temperatures and pressures. As demonstrated in this study, although state-of-the-art united-atom Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials for normal and branched alkanes provide accurate estimates for vapor-liquid equilibria properties, they tend to over-predict pressures for dense supercritical fluids and compressed liquids. The theoretical explanation for this observation is that the repulsive barrier is too steep for the ``optimal'' united-atom Mie $\lambda$-6 potential parameterized with vapor-liquid properties. Bayesian inference confirms that no feasible combination of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ is capable of simultaneously predicting saturated vapor pressures, saturated liquid densities, and pressures at high temperatures and densities.

%RAM2: A lot of failed attempts. Can clean these up once we like our abstract.

\section*{Purpose}

%The aim of this study is to demonstrate, using Bayesian inference, that a UA Mie force field cannot adequately predict VLE and PVT of compressed liquids and supercritical fluids for normal and branched alkanes. For adequate prediction of VLE and compressed liquid pressures, we recommend using AUA or AA models. % or perhaps Exp-6 or extended Lennard-Jones, i.e. 12-10-8-6. %We then use simple Bayes factors (if not RJMC) to determine the optimal value of lambda for predicting compressed liquid pressures. 
%%%% RAM: Andrei and I think that we don't really need to find the best lambda value since most people would not be willing to sacrifice Pvsat just to match high pressures. Also Andrei wants to minimize the amount of effort/time required to get this paper ready.
%%%% MRS: ``since most people would not be willing to sacrifice Pvsat'': right, then just state the reasonings for not including it, that you don't think people would care.
%MRS: is it just VLE at high pressures, or everywhere?
%\section*{Outline}
%MRS: if no data on 12-10-8-6, don't recommend.
%MRS: if you say people should use AUA, then the questions is whether you need to do simulations.  It depends what the current thinking on the field is.  If AUA and Mie are thought to work, then showing that Mie doesn't is sufficient for the thesis.

%I think for this paper we could focus on just a couple of these points. RJMC needs to be working for some of these. Lambda I could probably do without RJMC. Same with CH2. But others it would be necessary. 
%I basically already have the results for lambda (just ethane) and for the CH2 sites.
%

\section{Introduction}

An accurate understanding of the relationship between pressure, volume (or density, $\rho$), and temperature $(PVT)$ and caloric properties (such as heat capacity) for a given compound is essential for designing industrial chemical processes. Fundamental equations of state (FEOS), such as those based on the Helmholtz free energy, are a powerful approach for estimating $PVT$ behavior and caloric properties. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) REFPROP (Reference Fluid Properties) currently provides FEOS for around one hundred chemical species \cite{LEMMON-RP91}. Unfortunately, most compounds do not have sufficient (reliable) experimental data covering a wide range of pressures, densities, and temperatures to develop a highly-accurate FEOS. Since FEOS are semi-empirical and have 15-30 fitting parameters, the FEOS predictions can result in large errors at temperatures and pressures that are significantly higher than those used in parameterizing the FEOS. Therefore, improvement in an FEOS at high temperatures and pressures necessitates additional data for those conditions.
% using an FEOS to extrapolate to temperatures and pressures that are significantly higher than those used in parameterizing the FEOS can result in large errors
% Most compounds do not have sufficient reliable experimental data over a wide enough region of phase space. 
%However, Thol et al. demonstrated that molecular simulation results at high temperatures and pressures can be used to supplement experimental data when developing fundamental equations of state \cite{Thol2016_siloxane}.
%Unfortunately, most compounds do not have sufficient (reliable) experimental data covering a wide range of pressures, densities, and temperatures are required to develop a highly-accurate FEOS, but are not available for most compounds.

The lack of experimental data at high temperatures and pressures, especially, is likely attributed to the inherent safety, cost, and complexity of such experiments. By contrast, molecular simulation (i.e. Monte Carlo, MC, and molecular dynamics, MD) methods at high temperatures and pressures do not suffer from any of these limitations. Therefore, in principle, molecular simulation can aid in developing FEOS \cite{Thol2016_LJ,Thol_LJTS,Rutkai2017,Lustig2015,Rutkai2015}. Although it is possible to fit an FEOS to just molecular simulation results, most studies implement hybrid data sets (i.e. from both experiment and molecular simulation) \cite{Rutkai2013}.

For example, several recent studies by Thol et al. supplement experimental data with molecular simulation results at temperatures and pressures beyond the range of available experimental temperatures and pressures \cite{Thol2016_siloxane_first,Thol2016_siloxane,Thol2017,Thol2015}. Specifically, experimental data were available for temperatures and pressures up to 580 K and 130 MPa, 590 K and 180 MPa, 450 K and 2 MPa, and 560 K and 100 MPa for hexamethyldisiloxane \cite{Thol2016_siloxane_first}, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \cite{Thol2016_siloxane}, ethylene oxide \cite{Thol2015}, and 1,2-dichloroethane \cite{Thol2017}, respectively. Molecular simulations were performed for these compounds at temperatures and pressures up to 1200 K and 600 MPa, 1200 K and 520 MPa, 1000 K and 700 MPa, 1000 K and 1200 MPa, respectively. The inclusion of these simulation results improved the performance of the FEOS at extreme temperatures and pressures. 

% Although it is possible to generate simulation results for the entire phase space, BLANK has shown that hybrid data sets 
% Most of the compounds studied by Refs BLANK are small compounds 
% 
%Typically, force fields are parameterized with vapor-liquid equilibria data

While previous studies have focused on small/hazardous compounds, the present study investigates normal and branched alkanes. Hydrocarbons are a fundamental feed-stock for many petrochemical processes and, therefore, large amounts of experimental data exist covering a wide range of $PVT$ phase space. For these reasons, REFPROP provides highly-accurate FEOS for several hydrocarbons, most of which are shorter-chains (less than 20 carbons) with limited branching (i.e. only methyl branches). The use of hybrid data sets is an appealing approach to develop FEOS for industrially relevant hydrocarbons with less experimental data, i.e. those with longer chain-lengths or a higher degree of branching.

% is to utilize hybrid data sets consisting of experimental data and molecular simulation results at extreme temperatures and pressures. 

%In addition, one of our aims is to determine whether the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential for normal and branched alkanes is reliable enough that a FEOS could be developed strictly from molecular simulation results.

The primary limitation for implementing molecular simulation at extreme temperatures and pressures is whether or not the force field, which is typically parameterized using VLE data, is reliable at those conditions.  
%MRS2: is the next clause repetitive?
%RAM2: No. I reworded it to make this more clear
%i.e. if the VLE optimal parameters are transferable to higher temperatures and pressures. 
%the VLE-optimal force field does adequately predict the homogeneous fluid region
For example, it was demonstrated that VLE-optimized force fields for small compounds, such as noble gases, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen chloride, do adequately represent the homogeneous fluid region \cite{Rutkai2013}. In this study, we investigate how well the traditional force fields for predicting VLE of normal and branched alkanes extrapolate to higher temperatures (supercritical fluid) and pressures (compressed liquid). This analysis is performed for four normal and four branched alkanes by comparing the simulated compressibility factor $(Z)$ with the REFPROP correlations. Note that the simulation conditions do not go beyond the range of validity for the respective compounds, so that we can assume the REFPROP correlations are reliable.

The most accurate force fields for estimating hydrocarbon VLE properties (i.e. $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$) are the Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE) \cite{TraPPE,Martin1999} (and, especially, the recent TraPPE-2 \cite{TraPPEUA2}), Errington \cite{Exp6}, anisotropic-united-atom (AUA4) \cite{AUA4,Bourasseau2002}, Potoff \cite{Mie,Potoff_branched}, and Transferable anisotropic Mie potential (TAMie) \cite{TAMie,Weidler2016}. The TraPPE and Potoff force fields use a united-atom (UA) model while the TraPPE-2, Errington, AUA4, and TAMie force fields use an anisotropic-united-atom (AUA) model. Both a UA and AUA model group the hydrogen interactions with their neighboring carbon atom. However, the UA model assumes that the UA interaction site is that of the carbon atom, while an AUA model assumes that the AUA interaction site is shifted away from the carbon atom and towards the hydrogen atom(s). Although, in theory, an all-atom (AA) force field should yield more accurate results, from a parameterization standpoint, it is much easier to ensure that a global minimum is obtained when parameterizing UA and AUA force fields since fewer (highly correlated) parameters are optimized simultaneously. Furthermore, the reduced computational cost is an additional benefit of the UA and AUA approach.

%
%implicit hydrogens (IH) instead of explicit hydrogens (EH). An IH model does not directly compute the hydrogen interactions, rather the hydrogens are grouped with their neighboring carbon atom. The two classes of IH models are united-atom (UA) and anisotropic-united-atom (AUA). A UA model assumes that the UA interaction site is that of the carbon atom, while a AUA model assumes that the AUA interaction site is shifted away from the carbon atom and towards the hydrogen atom(s). Although, in theory, an all-atom (AA) force field should yield more accurate results, from a parameterization standpoint, it is much easier to ensure that a global minimum is obtained when optimizing UA and AUA force fields. The reduced computational cost is an additional benefit of the UA and AUA approach.
%
%Several literature UA and AUA force fields have been optimized to agree with VLE properties for normal and branched alkanes. Two of the most widely used UA based force fields are the TraPPE LJ 12-6 and Potoff Mie 16-6, while two of the most successful AUA force fields are the AUA4 LJ 12-6 and TAMie Mie 14-6. 

In addition to the 
%classification 
division between
of UA and AUA force fields, the existing force fields differ in the non-bonded functional form and corresponding parameters. The TraPPE, TraPPE-2, and AUA4 force fields use a Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12-6 potential, while the Potoff and TAMie force fields use the Mie $\lambda$-6 (or generalized Lennard-Jones) potential, and the Errington force field uses the Buckingham exponential-6 (Exp-6) potential. The three-parameter Mie $\lambda$-6 and Exp-6 potentials are more flexible than the two-parameter LJ 12-6 potential as the additional adjustable parameter controls the steepness of the repulsive barrier.

% have three adjustable parameters while the LJ 12-6 potential only has two parameters.

Previous work demonstrated that the UA LJ 12-6 potential cannot adequately estimate both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ for \textit{n}-alkanes \cite{Pareto_LJPQ,Mess4}. For this reason, the TraPPE-UA force field was primarily developed to agree with saturated liquid densities \cite{TraPPE}. By contrast, accurate prediction of both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ over a wide temperature range is possible by varying the repulsive exponent of the LJ potential (i.e. the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential). Typically, when parameterized to VLE data, the optimal value of $\lambda$ is greater than 12 with a corresponding increase in the well depth $(\epsilon)$. Specifically, for most hydrocarbons, the Potoff UA force field \cite{Mie,Potoff_branched} uses $\lambda = 16$ while the TAMie force field \cite{TAMie} uses $\lambda = 14$. Gordon also demonstrated that reliable viscosities can be obtained from a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 model for \textit{n}-alkanes by using $\lambda = 14$ and $\lambda = 20$ for the CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ sites, respectively (note the subtle difference in how Gordon defines the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential, a.k.a. ``mod-n-6'') \cite{Gordon2006}. 
%MRS2: don't make this a parenthetical. Full sentences generally shouldn't be.
%RAM2: Alright, I admit that I use this tactic too often.
It is interesting to note that Gordon and Galli{\'e}ro et al. report $\lambda$ values of 11 and 10, respectively, for UA methane when optimized with viscosity data \cite{Gordon2006,Galliero2005}.

%(It is interesting to note that, for UA methane, Gordon and Galli{\'e}ro et al. reported that the optimal $\lambda$ to reproduce viscosity data is less than 12 (11 and 10, respectively) \cite{Gordon2006,Galliero2005}.)

%(It is interesting to note that Gordon and Galli{\'e}ro et al. report $\lambda$ values of 11 and 10, respectively, for UA methane when optimized with viscosity data \cite{Gordon2006,Galliero2005}.)

However, there are some theoretical concerns that increasing the repulsive exponent might have some undesirable consequences, especially at high pressures, where 
%close range interactions will become more prevalent 
particles will spend more time with very short  pairwise distances
than at VLE conditions. For example, several older studies demonstrated that neither an all-atom LJ 12-6 or an all-atom LJ 9-6 is adequate to reproduce high-level \textit{ab initio} calculations of \textit{n}-alkanes ranging from methane to \textit{n}-butane \cite{Rowley1999,Rowley2001,Hayes2004}. 
%MRS2: can you be more precise?  Which ab initio energies?  The entire pairwise curve? cluster energies?
%RAM2: These are single-point energies computed at several different configurations and center-of-mass distances
The studies of Rowley et al. suggest a Morse potential is necessary for accurate representation of \textit{ab initio} dimer energies. Hayes et al. confirms these results while also emphasizing that the short-range repulsive forces, which are most important when computing high pressures in molecular simulation, are poorly represented with an AA LJ 12-6 or an AA LJ 9-6 model. Specifically, the LJ 12-6 potential is too steep, and only slight improvement in the repulsive region is observed for the LJ 9-6 potential. %MRS2: suggest removing parenthetical, as well as as a brief aside; If you talk about Morse, then talking about Buckingham as well. 
%RAM2: Done
It is interesting that Hayes et al. also highlights deficiencies in the repulsive region for the Buckingham exponential-6 potential. 
%MRS2: Suggest actually writing out the general Mie equation earlier in the intro,  just for concreteness in the introduction, then can refer back to it when defining specific potentials.  Couldn't hurt to put morse and buckingham, but not vital, since you don't really explore it.  
%RAM2: I thought about this too, but it seemed strange to have an equation in the introduction.
Recently, Kulakova et al. used Bayesian inference to conclude that experimental data for argon, specifically the radial distribution functions of liquid and vapor at varying temperatures and densities, support $\lambda$ values between 6 and 10, while quantum argon dimer energies support $\lambda$ values between 12 and 14 \cite{Kulakova2017}. They suggest that these larger values of $\lambda$ should not be used for liquid phase simulations. By contrast, two other studies of noble gases, including argon, support $\lambda \ge 12$ \cite{Galliero2005,Mick_Mie}. Specifically, Mick et al. reports a 13-6 potential for argon, while Galli{\'e}ro et al. states that the 12-6 potential is superior for argon than the 10-6, 14-6, 16-6, 18-6, and 20-6 potentials. The primary explanation for this discrepancy is the choice of experimental data. The conclusions from Kulakova et al. are based on the radial distribution function, while Galli{\'e}ro et al. used viscosity and pressure, and Mick et al. utilized VLE data.

Structural properties, such as the radial distribution function, and \textit{ab initio} calculations provide considerable insight into the true repulsive barrier \cite{Kulakova2017,Galliero2005}. However, the ``correct'' value of $\lambda$ does not guarantee adequate prediction of VLE and/or $PVT$ behavior. This is primarily because the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is only an approximation to the real potential and, thus, it is not flexible enough to agree with both the repulsive and attractive regions. Instead, only the region that is most sensitive to the target experimental data will be adequately represented, which for VLE data is typically the effective-size, depth of the energy minimum, and the dispersive tail. Furthermore, the ``optimal'' $\lambda$ is not necessarily the ``true'' $\lambda$ because force fields use effective parameter sets that account for assumptions, such as pair-wise additivity (i.e. excluding three-, four-, etc. body interactions) or the lack of explicit hydrogens. For example, a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is simply not capable of predicting VLE properties of ethane for $\lambda < 12$ (see Figures 1-2 of Reference \citenum{Mie}), despite theoretical evidence that the repulsive barrier should be softer than $\lambda = 12$.

%This is primarily because force fields use ``effective'' parameter sets that try to account for assumptions, such as pair-wise additivity (i.e. excluding three-, four-, etc. body interactions) or the lack of explicit hydrogens. Furthermore, because the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is only an approximation to the real potential, it is not flexible enough to agree with both the repulsive and attractive region. Instead, only the regions that impact the target experimental data are most accurate, which for VLE data is typically the effective-size, depth of the energy minimum, and the dispersive tail.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 model is adequate for predicting \textit{both} VLE and $PVT$ at high temperatures and pressures for alkanes. Although it is difficult to know if the theoretical studies for noble gases and all-atom \textit{n}-alkane models are applicable to UA models for normal and branched alkanes, the working hypothesis based on previous studies is that a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential performs poorly at high pressures if parameterized with VLE data. 
%MRS2: above: be specific as to what evidence from above you are using to reach this conclusion so the reader knows.
%RAM2: OK, hopefully this is better
This assessment is of practical engineering importance for deciding whether or not UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force fields should be used when developing fundamental equations of state for alkanes based on hybrid data sets.

The outline for this study is the following. Section \ref{Methods I} discusses the simulation and force field details. Section \ref{Case Study} is a case study for normal and branched alkanes using the existing force fields developed based on VLE properties. Section \ref{Methods II} explains how Bayesian inference is employed to investigate the adequacy of the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential. Section \ref{Results} presents the results from the Bayesian analysis with recommendations and limitations in Section \ref{Discussion}. Section \ref{Conclusions} reports the primary conclusions of this study.

\subsection{Simulation Details}
%MRS2: provide justification for number and choice of molecules.
%RAM2: Done
Four normal and four branched alkanes of varying chain-length and degree of branching are simulated in this study. Specifically, we simulate ethane, propane, \textit{n}-butane, \textit{n}-octane, isobutane (2-methylpropane), isohexane (2-methylpentane), isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane), and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane). These compounds were chosen to represent a diverse set of the normal and branched alkanes available in REFPROP \cite{LEMMON-RP91}.

%MRS2: might want to be explicit there are no charges (helps to remind people)  
%RAM2: Done
%MRS2: how is the vdw truncated?  I would suggest distributing the input files in supporting information as part of best practices.
%RAM2: How specific do you think I should be for discussing vdw cut-offs?
%RAM2: I plan on including input files.
Simulations for this study are performed in the $NVT$ ensemble (constant number of molecules, $N$, constant volume, $V$, and constant temperature, $T$) using GROMACS version 2018 \cite{GROMACS_2018}. Each simulation uses the Velocity Verlet integrator with a 2 fs time-step, 1.4 nm cut-off for non-bonded interactions with tail corrections for energy and pressure, Nos{\'e}-Hoover thermostat with a time constant of 1 ps, and fixed bond-lengths are constrained using LINCS with a LINCS-order of eight. Coulombic interactions are not computed as none of the force fields require partial charges for the compounds studied. The equilibration time was 0.1 ns for ethane and propane, 0.2 ns for \textit{n}-butane, and 0.5 ns for all other compounds. The production time was 1 ns for ethane, 2 ns for propane and \textit{n}-butane, and 4 ns for all other compounds. Replicate simulations were performed for \textit{n}-octane to validate that a single MD run of this length agrees with the average of several replicates, to within the combined uncertainty. A system size of 400 molecules is used for ethane, propane, and \textit{n}-butane, while all other compounds use 800 molecules. Example input files are provided as Supporting Information.

%MRS2: these are for ITIC, correct? State that, so it's not vague wat the purpose of these are.
%RAM2: Done
Simulations are performed along a supercritical isotherm (with a reduced temperature, $T_{\rm r} \approx 1.2$) and five saturated liquid density isochores. Nine densities are simulated along the supercritical isotherm $(T^{\rm IT})$ with five densities being the same as the isochore densities. Two additional temperatures are simulated along each isochore, with one being the REFPROP saturation temperature $(T^{\rm sat})$ while the inverse of the second isochore temperature is the average of $1/T^{\rm IT}$ and $1/T^{\rm sat}$. Thus, a total of 19 simulations are performed for each compound and force field. The specific state points for each compound studied are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:simulation_conditions}, with the REFPROP saturation curve included as a reference. Tabulated values for the state points of each compound are provided in Supporting Information.

\end{figure}

The state points depicted in Figure \ref{fig:simulation_conditions} correspond to the recommended conditions for the isothermal isochoric integration (ITIC) algorithm \cite{Mostafa_Diss,Postdoc_1}. 
ITIC converts the departure internal energies $(U^{\rm dep})$ and compressibility factors $(Z)$ obtained at the 19 state points to saturated VLE properties, namely, $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$.
The 
%fundamental 
equations for ITIC are: 
\begin{equation} \label{ITIC A}
\frac{A^{\rm dep}}{R_{\rm g}T^{\rm sat}} = \int_{0}^{\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}}\frac{Z-1}{\rho} \partial \rho |_{T = T^{\rm IT}} + \int_{T^{\rm IT}}^{T^{\rm sat}}U^{\rm dep}\partial\left(\frac{1}{R_{\rm g}T}\right)|_{\rho=\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{ITIC rhov}
\rho_{\rm v}^{\rm sat} \approx \rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat} \exp \left( \frac{A^{\rm dep}}{R_{\rm g}T^{\rm sat}} + Z_{\rm l}^{\rm sat} - 1 - 2 B_2 \rho_{\rm v}^{\rm sat} - 1.5 B_3 (\rho_{\rm v}^{\rm sat})^2 \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{ITIC Pv}
P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat} \approx \left(1 + B_2 \rho_{\rm v}^{\rm sat} + B_3 (\rho_{\rm v}^{\rm sat})^2\right)\rho_{\rm v}^{\rm sat} R_{\rm g}T^{\rm sat}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{ITIC Zl}
Z_{\rm l}^{\rm sat} = \frac{P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}}{\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat} R_{\rm g} T^{\rm sat}}
\end{equation}
where $A^{\rm dep} \equiv A-A^{\rm ig}$ is the Helmholtz free energy departure from ideal gas for temperature $(T)$ equal to the saturation temperature $(T^{\rm sat})$ and density $(\rho)$ equal to the saturated liquid density $(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat})$, $U^{\rm dep} \equiv U-U^{\rm ig}$ is the internal energy departure, $Z_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ is the saturated liquid compressibility factor $(Z)$, $B_2$ is the second virial coefficient, $B_3$ is the third virial coefficient, $T^{\rm IT}$ is the isothermal temperature, and $R_{\rm g}$ is the universal gas constant. For details regarding the implementation of ITIC, see Reference \citenum{Postdoc_1}. As discussed in our previous work \cite{Postdoc_1}, the $B_2$ and $B_3$ values found in Equations \ref{ITIC rhov}-\ref{ITIC Pv} are calculated using REFPROP correlations \citenum{LEMMON-RP91}. The use of REFPROP correlations introduces a small bias in the resulting $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, which is accounted for in Section \ref{Bayesian Analysis}.

\subsection{Force field} \label{Force Field}

A united-atom (UA) or anisotropic-united-atom (AUA) representation is used for each compound studied. The UA and AUA groups required for normal and branched alkanes are sp$^3$ hybridized CH$_3$, CH$_2$, CH, and C sites. For most literature models, a single (transferable) parameter set is assigned for each interaction site. However, two exceptions exist for the force fields studied. First, TAMie implements a different set of CH$_3$ parameters for ethane and other alkanes. Second, Potoff reports a ``generalized'' and ``short/long'' (S/L) CH and C parameter set. The Potoff ``generalized'' CH and C parameter set is an attempt at a completely transferable set. However, since the ``generalized'' parameters performed poorly for some compounds, the S/L parameter set was proposed, where the ``short'' and ``long'' parameters are implemented when the number of carbons in the backbone is $\le 4$ and $> 4$, respectively. 

%MRS2: suggest figures of UA and AUA, AUA4 to show the difference for some representitive molecule
%RAM2: Hmmm... I do not know the best way to do this. I have only depicted molecules once before in a publication. I used Gaussian, but the figures were not great. If you have a simple way to do this I would be interested.
A fixed bond-length is used for each bond between UA or AUA sites. Although TAMie is an AUA force field, only the terminal CH$_3$ sites have a displacement in the interaction site. This convention is much simpler to implement than other AUA approaches (such as AUA4) where non-terminal (i.e. CH$_2$ and CH) interaction sites also have a displacement distance. For this reason, we do not attempt to simulate the AUA4 force field for any compounds containing CH$_2$ and CH interaction sites. For the compounds and force fields simulated, the anisotropic shift in a terminal interaction site (i.e. CH$_3$) is treated simply as a longer effective bond-length (see Table \ref{tab:bond-lengths}). The bond-length for all non-terminal sites is 0.154 nm, except for the Errington Exp-6 force field which uses 0.1535 nm for CH$_2$-CH$_2$ bonds.

\begin{table}[h!]

Empty table entries for Exp-6 and TraPPE-2 denote that the force field does not contain the corresponding interaction site type.

Specifically, AUA4 requires CH$_2$ and CH interaction sites that are not along the C-C bond axis.} \label{tab:bond-lengths}

The angle and dihedral energies are computed using the same functional forms for each force field. Angular bending interactions are evaluated using a harmonic potential:
\begin{equation*}
u^{\rm bend} = \frac{k_\theta}{2} \left(\theta-\theta_0\right)^2
\end{equation*}
where $u^{\rm bend}$ is the bending energy, $\theta$ is the instantaneous bond angle, $\theta_0$ is the equilibrium bond angle, and $k_\theta$ is the harmonic force constant which is equal to 62500 K/rad$^2$ for all bonding angles. Dihedral torsional interactions are determined using a cosine series:
\begin{equation*}
u^{\rm tors} = c_1 [1+\cos{\phi}] + c_2 [1-\cos{2\phi}] + c_3 [1+\cos{3\phi}]
\end{equation*}
where $u^{\rm tors}$ is the torsional energy, $\phi$ is the dihedral angle and $c_i$ are the Fourier constants. The equilibrium bond angles and torsional parameters are found in Tables \ref{tab:angles}-\ref{tab:torsions}, respectively. Note that the Errington $c_i$ values for CH$_x$-CH$_2$-CH$_2$-CH$_y$ are a factor of two less than those reported in Table \ref{tab:torsions}. 
%MRS2: note that there are multiple ways to represent the same torsion
%(1-2-3-4 and 4-3-2-1), and in some case, the barriers are lower for torsional parameters

Non-bonded interaction energies and forces between sites located in two different molecules or separated by more than three bonds are calculated using either a Lennard-Jones 12-6, Mie $\lambda$-6, or Buckingham Exponential-6 potential. The Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Mie}
u^{\rm vdw}(\epsilon,\sigma,\lambda;r) = \left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda - 6}\right)\left(\frac{\lambda}{6}\right)^{\frac{6}{\lambda - 6}} \epsilon \left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^\lambda - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]
\end{equation} 
where $u^{\rm vdw}$ is the van der Waals interaction, $\sigma$ is the distance $(r)$ where $u^{\rm vdw} = 0$, $-\epsilon$ is the energy of the potential at the minimum $\left(\text{i.e. }u^{\rm vdw} = -\epsilon \text{ and } \frac{\partial u^{\rm vdw}}{\partial r} = 0 \text{ for } r=r_{\rm min} \right)$, and $\lambda$ is the repulsive exponent. 

Note that the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential reduces to the LJ 12-6 potential for $\lambda = 12$. Therefore, the LJ 12-6 potential can be considered a special subclass of the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential. It is important to mention that, although an attractive exponent of 6 has a strong theoretical basis, $\lambda = 12$ is a historical artifact that was chosen primarily for computational purposes \cite{Allen1987}. For the same reason (i.e. computational efficiency), a common practice to date is to use integer values of $\lambda$ in Equation \ref{eq:Mie}. The non-bonded force field parameters for TraPPE (and TraPPE-2), Potoff, AUA4, and TAMie are provided in Table \ref{tab:nonbonded params}.

The Errington force field utilizes an exponential-6 model:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Buckingham}
u^{\rm vdw}(\epsilon,r_{\rm min},\alpha;r) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{\epsilon}{1-\frac{6}{\alpha}} \left[\frac{6}{\alpha} \exp\left(\alpha\left[1-\frac{r}{r_{\rm min}}\right]\right) - \left(\frac{r_{\rm min}}{r}\right)^6\right] & \text{for}\ r>r_{\rm max} \\
\infty           & \text{for}\ r<r_{\rm max}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $u^{\rm vdw}$, $\epsilon$, and $r$ are the same as in Equation \ref{eq:Mie}, $r_{\rm min}$ is the distance that corresponds to the minimum in the potential (i.e $u^{\rm vdw}(r_{\rm min})=-\epsilon$), $\alpha$ is a Buckingham exponential-6 parameter, and $r_{\rm max}$ is the smallest positive value for which $\frac{du^{\rm vdw}}{dr}=0$. The Errington non-bonded parameters are found in Table \ref{tab:nonbonded Exp6}. (Note that Errington reported values for $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\alpha$. We computed $r_{\rm min}$ and $r_{\rm max}$ to facilitate compatibility with Equation \ref{eq:Buckingham} and future validation of our results.)

Non-bonded interactions between two different site types (i.e. cross-interactions) are determined using Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules \cite{Allen1987} for $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$, an arithmetic mean for the repulsive exponent $(\lambda)$ (as recommended by Potoff and Bernard-Brunel \cite{Mie}), and a geometric mean for $\alpha$ (as recommended by Errington and Panagiotopoulos \cite{Exp6}):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lorentz-Berthelot_eps}
\epsilon_{ij} = \sqrt{\epsilon_{ii} \epsilon_{jj}}

%%MRS: need to make it clearer what your hypothesis is, then.  If it's just ``Mie not good'', then restrict it.  If the goal is to find something better, which might be more impactful. But it can be a short paper. If its ``nothing existing is good'', then will need to include others.
%%MRS: Looking more carefully, I think your main idea is not that Mie isn't that good, but NONE of the existing UA isotropic functional forms are not that good. That is a more general conclusion, but doesn't force you to posit a new one within the scope of this paper. It does make a stronger statement; if you say ``Mie isn't good'', then people will wonder, why don't you just say what is good.  If you say none of the ``standard UA approaches are good'' that's more important.   You MIGHT need to say ``But this approach can work''.  That might require more work than there is time for this time.

%%MRS: My instinct, if ``anisotropic'' UA works for this system, it might not be worth it that much to develop a new functional form.  Unless there's strong reason it might be useful more generally.  we can discuss goals a bit; it really depends on goals.

\section{Case study for alkanes} \label{Case Study}

The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate that the existing UA and AUA force fields for normal and branched alkanes that were parameterized with VLE properties do not predict the proper $PVT$ behavior at higher temperatures and pressures (with the exception of ethane for the TraPPE-2 potential). Figures \ref{fig:IC_normal_alkanes} and \ref{fig:IC_branched_alkanes} plot the compressibility factor with respect to inverse temperature for \textit{n}-alkanes and branched alkanes, respectively. Note that saturation corresponds to $Z \approx 0$ for each isochore. The ``Potoff'' results in Figure \ref{fig:IC_branched_alkanes} are only for the the ``short/long'' model, since the ``short/long'' model is more accurate than the ``generalized'' model. The results for the ``generalized'' model do not provide any additional insight but are found in the Supporting Information.

%The ``Potoff'' results in Figure \ref{fig:IC_branched_alkanes} are only for the the ``short/long'' model, since the ``short/long'' model is more accurate than the ``generalized'' model. Specifically, isobutane and neopentane use the ``short'' parameters, while isohexane and isooctane use the ``long'' parameters. The results for the ``generalized'' model do not provide any additional insight but are found in the Supporting Information. 

%Several force fields in the literature have been optimized to agree with VLE properties for normal and branched alkanes. Two of the most widely used united-atom based force fields are the TraPPE LJ 12-6 and Potoff Mie 16-6.

%It has been demonstrated that the united-atom LJ 12-6 potential cannot adequately estimate both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$. By contrast, when properly optimized, the Mie 16-6 potential can accurately predict both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ over a wide temperature range. However, there is some concern that increasing the repulsive exponent (in this case, from 12 to 16) might have some undesirable consequences, especially at high pressures, where close range interactions will become more significant.

Figure \ref{fig:IC_normal_alkanes} demonstrates that the existing literature force fields for \textit{n}-alkanes, while accurate for VLE, do not capture the correct $PVT$ behavior at high pressures, i.e. the  higher temperatures and highest isochore densities $(\rho_3$ and $\rho_4)$. Figure \ref{fig:IC_branched_alkanes} shows the same erroneous trend in $Z$ for branched alkanes. Note that the error in $Z$ at high temperatures is less obvious because these force fields are typically not as reliable at predicting VLE for branched alkanes as for \textit{n}-alkanes, i.e. notice the large deviations at $Z \approx 0$. That being said, it is clear in both Figures \ref{fig:IC_normal_alkanes}-\ref{fig:IC_branched_alkanes} that none of the force fields adequately reproduces $Z$ over the entire temperature range, or the slope of $Z$ with respect to inverse $T$.

% Note that the error in the slope of $Z$ with respect to inverse $T$ is less obvious because these force fields are typically less reliable at VLE for branched alkanes than for \textit{n}-alkanes, i.e. notice the large deviations at $Z \approx 0$.

%Figure \ref{fig:IC_branched_alkanes} shows that these force fields are typically less reliable at VLE for branched alkanes than for \textit{n}-alkanes, i.e. notice the large deviations at $Z \approx 0$. More importantly, the same erroneous trend in $Z$ is observed as in Figure \ref{fig:IC_normal_alkanes}.

In general, 
%MRS: clarified, bias singular suggests it's the same, but each is different.
%a clear bias is
clear systematic biases are observed for the LJ 12-6 potentials (TraPPE-UA and AUA4) and the Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials (Potoff and TAMie). Specifically, the LJ 12-6 and Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials under- and over-predict $Z$ at high pressures, respectively. These results are intuitive as the repulsive barriers are steeper for the respective Mie 16-6 and 14-6 potentials of the Potoff and TAMie force fields. A more surprising trend is that the Errington (AUA Exp-6) model also has a positive bias at high pressures. This appears to suggest that the repulsive barrier is too steep, however, the Exp-6 model is softer than the LJ 12-6 at very short distances. Therefore, it is more likely that the Exp-6 repulsive forces are over-predicted for the close-range distances that are sampled in molecular dynamics, i.e. $0.8 \sigma \approx r < r_{\rm min}$. Alternatively, since the exponential contribution is non-negligible for $r_{\rm min} < r \approx 1.5 \sigma$, it is possible that the Exp-6 under-predicts the attractive forces in this region. More definitive conclusions are possible for the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential as the impact of $\lambda$ is more directly comparable.

% or that the attractive forces are under-predicted for $r > r_{\rm min}$.  

%This suggests that an exponential repulsive barrier is too steep, at least for the distances that are sampled at these state points.
%MRS2: could suggest that the size parmeter is not chosen well; far enough up, it could be sufficiently soft, but if the size parameter isn't quite right, it could be too stiff in this region.
%RAM2: True. Really it just shows that the repulsive forces are either too high or that the attractive forces are too weak. So it can be that the well has too steep of a slope or that the tail is too gradual.

%MRS2: I don't know that TraPPE-2 ``reproduces'', since at the highest P, it is outside the REFPROP bounds. And somewhat off at high T.  Maybe stating that it's the best of them.  Can you make a more quantitiatve statement, perhaps a RMS error compared to the other models, rather than making a binary statement (unless there are clear criteria for the binary statement, of course - which would involve a definition of ``reproduces'').
%RAM2: True. The TraPPE-2 is not perfect. It is still outside of the REFPROP uncertainty. I have tried rewording this.
%MRS2: maybe reverse the density ordering labeling? Intiuitively, one would expect rho_i+1 > rho_i.
%RAM2: Done
The one exception to this trend is the TraPPE-2 model for ethane, which has the most accurate prediction of the entire $PVT$ phase space simulated. Specifically, TraPPE-2 reproduces $Z$ to within the REFPROP uncertainties for all state points except at the two highest densities along the supercritical isotherm, i.e. $T=T^{IT}$ and $\rho = \rho_3$ or $\rho_4$. The average percent deviation (AD\%) relative to the REFPROP correlations for pressure at these state points, referred to as $P^{\rm high}$, is only 3\%. 

The performance of TraPPE-2 is somewhat surprising considering this force field has only three fitting parameters ($\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and the effective bond-length) while the TAMie model has these three parameters and an additional fitting parameter $(\lambda)$. It is important to note that TraPPE-2 uses a much longer effective bond-length of 0.230 nm while TAMie did not consider bond-lengths larger than 0.194 nm. Therefore, the fact that the TraPPE-2 force field extrapolates to high pressures better than TAMie suggests that, at high pressures, it is important to account for hydrogens either explicitly (AA model) or with a longer effective bond-length than that typically used for AUA models (see Table \ref{tab:bond-lengths}). It is also possible that a four parameter optimization, such as that used by TAMie, is overfit to the VLE data and would perform better if high pressure $PVT$ data were included in the parameterization.

Unfortunately, a direct comparison of the non-bonded interactions for AUA force fields is difficult because each model has a different anisotropic displacement, i.e. effective bond-length. 
%MRS2: do you need both i.e. and parentheses above?
%RAM2: No. That is just my tendency.
By contrast, 
%MRS2: nominalization.
%a comparison of 
comparing TraPPE-UA and Potoff is straightforward because they use the same bond-lengths and the same non-bonded Mie $\lambda$-6 potential (Equation \ref{eq:Mie}). For example, since the TraPPE-UA (LJ 12-6) potential under-predicts $Z$ and the Potoff (UA Mie 16-6) potential over-predicts $Z$, it seems reasonable that a UA Mie 13-6, 14-6, or 15-6 model 
%MRS2: suggest
%would 
could
demonstrate the proper trend, if parameterized appropriately. To investigate this hypothesis, the remainder of this document focuses on the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential, where all bond-lengths are 0.154 nm. 

Specifically, we perform a Bayesian uncertainty quantification analysis to determine if there exists a set of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ that reasonably predicts $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, and $PVT$ of supercritical fluids and compressed liquids. The results in Section \ref{Results} suggest that the optimal value of $\lambda$ (13 or 14) for predicting $PVT$ of supercritical fluids and compressed liquids is not capable of predicting VLE properties accurately. To understand this point, it is important to remember that the TraPPE-UA LJ 12-6 force field was optimized using only $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ because the UA LJ 12-6 model cannot adequately predict both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$.

%However, as demonstrated in Section \ref{Results}, there does not exist a set of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ that reasonably predicts $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, and $PVT$ of supercritical fluids and compressed liquids for the UA model. To understand this point, it is important to remember that the UA LJ 12-6 (TraPPE-UA) force field cannot adequately predict both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$. In other words, determining the optimal value of $\lambda$ for predicting $PVT$ of supercritical fluids and compressed liquids does not guarantee accurate prediction of $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$. See Section \ref{Results} for a further discussion.



%Although the TAMie potential uses a softer repulsive exponent than Potoff (14 instead of 16), it consistently over-predicts the pressure for supercritical fluids and compressed liquids. The same is true for the Errington Exp-6 model. By contrast, the TraPPE-2 potential provides extremely reliable estimates of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, and the PVT behavior at high pressures and temperatures. Although the TraPPE-2 model is only available for ethane and ethylene, these results suggest that at extreme pressures either an AUA or AA model should be used to better account for the hydrogens. That being said, alternative functional forms, such as the extended Lennard-Jones, should also be considered.

\section{Methods II} \label{Methods II}

The results presented in Section \ref{Case Study} demonstrate that none of the literature UA or AUA force fields, parameterized with VLE data, can reproduce the $PVT$ behavior for supercritical fluids and compressed liquids. However, there is uncertainty in the non-bonded parameters inherited from the VLE data. Therefore, by considering the inherent uncertainty, it is possible that 
%MRS2: what do you mean by ``equally probably'' here?
%equally probable 
%RAM2: Hopefully it is more clear now
a feasible parameter set exists that adequately predicts VLE and $PVT$ behavior. By contrast, if none of the feasible $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ values is capable of simultaneously predicting VLE properties and $PVT$ behavior at high pressures, we can conclude that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential (and Lennard-Jones 12-6 as a special case) is inadequate for this purpose and, therefore, should not be used when developing FEOS with molecular simulation results. 
%MRS2: do you want to qualify the above statement for high pressure.
%RAM2: done
%We perform this analysis only for \textit{n}-alkanes, because the CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ results suggest that a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is not adequate and, therefore, we did not find it necessary to repeat this process for the CH and C interaction sites.
%MRS2: The logic is a bit confusing.  Are you talking about the future results in the paper here?  That could be confusing for readers (it was for me) Perhaps rephrase to be explicit, something along the lines of ``We perform this analysis first for n-alkanes; if we can show that UA Mie lam-6 is insufficent for n-alkanes, then it will be unnecessary to further test models including CH and C molecules.''  Does that make sense.  
%RAM2: I agree. I have reordered these paragraphs. Hopefully this is better.
%We perform this analysis for \textit{n}-alkanes by quantifying the parameter uncertainty in the CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ interaction sites.

% Bayesian inference can quantify this parameter uncertainty by determining a joint distribution of feasible non-bonded parameter sets.

%%% I need to be careful here because I don't actually try to include PVT in the optimization
% recall that each of these force fields was parameterized using only VLE properties. Therefore, it is possible that including both VLE and $PVT$ properties in the parameterization objective function will improve the results.
%if no combination of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ is capable of predicting VLE properties and $PVT$ behavior, we can conclude that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential (and Lennard-Jones 12-6 as a special case) is inadequate for this purpose and, therefore, should not be used when developing FEOS with molecular simulation results.

Bayesian inference is a rigorous approach to quantify if the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is ``adequate''. 
%In order to rigorously quantify if the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is ``adequate'', we perform a Bayesian inference analysis.

%Bayesian inference is used to quantify the uncertainty in the non-bonded parameters $(\epsilon$ and $\sigma)$ and to determine the evidence for different values of $\lambda$. 
%Bayes theorem states that
%\begin{equation} \label{Bayes Theorem}
%Pr(\theta|D) = \frac{Pr(D|\theta)Pr(\theta)}{Pr(D)}
%\end{equation}
%where $Pr$ denotes a probability distribution function, $\theta$ is the parameter set (i.e. $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ for a given Mie $\lambda$-6 potential), and $D$ are the data. $Pr(\theta|D)$ is commonly referred to as the ``posterior'', $Pr(D|\theta)$ is the ``likelihood'' (alternatively expressed as $L(\theta|D)$), $Pr(\theta)$ is the ``prior'', and $Pr(D)$ is a normalization constant. 
%
%The evidence for different values of $\lambda$ is determined by integrating the numerator of Equation \ref{Bayes Theorem} for all values of $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$. The Bayes factor for two different values of $\lambda$ is obtained from the ratio of the respective evidences. (Note that this can be viewed as marginalizing the three-dimensional $(\epsilon, \sigma$, and $\lambda)$ distribution with respect to $\lambda$.) By assuming that the ``prior'' evidence is equal for all values of $\lambda$, the Bayes factor $(K)$ depends completely on the ``likelihood'':
%\begin{equation} \label{Bayes Factor}
%K = \frac{ \int L(\epsilon, \sigma, \lambda_1 | D) d\epsilon d\sigma}{ \int L(\epsilon, \sigma, \lambda_0 | D) d\epsilon d\sigma}
%\end{equation}
%where $\lambda_i$ are different (fixed) values of $\lambda$.
%
%Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the traditional approach for numerically sampling from the probability distribution $Pr(\theta|D)$. A Markov Chain is created by proposing new $\epsilon$ or $\sigma$ values and accepting those moves based on the ratio of the probability between the previous parameter set and the proposed parameter set:
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:Acceptance}
%\alpha = \min\left(1,\frac{Pr(\theta_{i+1}|D)}{Pr(\theta_i|D)}\right)
%\end{equation} 
%where $\alpha$ is the acceptance probability, $\theta_i$ is the previous parameter set, and $\theta_{i+1}$ is the proposed parameter set. The amount to which $\epsilon$ or $\sigma$ is varied $(\Delta \epsilon $ and $\Delta \sigma)$ for each MCMC step is tuned such that approximately $\frac{1}{3}$ of the moves are accepted. This ``tuning'' period (also referred to as a ``burn-in'' period) is followed by a production period where $\Delta \epsilon $ and $\Delta \sigma$ do not change. Details for MCMC are provided in Supporting Information (i.e. number of steps for burn-in and production, frequency that step sizes are updated, resulting acceptance percentages, etc.).
%
%Because MCMC moves are accepted based on Equation \ref{eq:Acceptance} and the denominator in Equation \ref{Bayes Theorem} (i.e. $Pr(D)$) does not depend on $\theta$, the acceptance probability is independent of $Pr(D)$. Also, we use a ``non-informative prior'' such that the acceptance probability is independent of $Pr(\theta)$ (although we do include a lower bound that the parameters are positive, i.e. $Pr(\theta)$ is uniform for all values of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ greater than 0). Therefore, the probability of accepting $\theta_{i+1}$ is based completely on the likelihood. For this reason, we discuss in some detail how we calculate $L(\theta|D)$.  
%
%The likelihood is calculated using a multi-variate normal distribution, $N(\mu, \Sigma)$. The covariance matrix $(\Sigma)$ accounts for the uncertainties of both the experimental data and the computational analysis (i.e. the methods discussed in Section \ref{Surrogate Model}). The uncertainties are assumed to be independent such that the combined variance is the sum of the experimental and computational variances \cite{Bay_MD}. The experimental data and corresponding uncertainties were obtained through the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) and are found in Supporting Information. The computational variances are discussed in Section \ref{Surrogate Model}.
%
%The parameter sets sampled from MCMC $(\theta_{\rm MCMC})$ provide an estimate of the uncertainty in $\theta$ (i.e. $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$) (see Figures \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_15_16_17_18_ethane} and \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_16_propane_butane_octane} in Section \ref{Results}). This parameter uncertainty propagates when estimating another property $(q)$, which may or may not be included in $D$. For example, although $D$ only consists of VLE properties ($\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, specifically) we also propagate the uncertainties in $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ to $Z$ at high temperatures and pressures by implementing posterior prediction. The probability distribution of $q$ $(Pr(q|D))$ is often approximated by developing a histogram of $q$ for the MCMC parameter sets, i.e. $q(\theta_{\rm MCMC})$. 
%
%Since a large number of MCMC samples are required for adequate representations of $Pr(\theta|D)$ and $Pr(q|D)$, MCMC is computationally infeasible when a direct molecular simulation is required for every $\theta_{\rm MCMC}$. For this reason, a surrogate model is used to approximate $L(\theta|D)$ (and, thereby, $Pr(\theta|D)$) and $q(\theta_{\rm MCMC})$ (and, thereby, $Pr(q|D)$).
%%Perhaps I should be more specific. The surrogate model is not for estimating L, it is for estimating q (or y if I want to define L in terms of y or yhat)

\subsection{Bayesian Analysis} \label{Bayesian Analysis}

\subsubsection{Theory}

Bayesian inference is used to quantify the uncertainty in the non-bonded parameters $(\epsilon$ and $\sigma)$ and to determine the evidence for different values of $\lambda$. 
Bayes theorem states
\begin{equation} \label{Bayes Theorem}
Pr(\theta|D,M) = \frac{Pr(D|\theta,M)Pr(\theta|M)}{Pr(D|M)}
\end{equation}
where $Pr$ denotes a probability distribution function, $\theta$ is the parameter set ($\epsilon$ and $\sigma$), $M$ is the model (Mie $\lambda$-6 for a given value of $\lambda$) and $D$ are the data ($\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$). $Pr(\theta|D,M)$ is commonly referred to as the ``posterior'', $Pr(D|\theta,M)$ is the ``likelihood'' (alternatively expressed as $L(\theta|D,M)$), $Pr(\theta|M)$ is the ``prior'', and $Pr(D|M)$ is a normalization constant which is also the ``model evidence''. 

The ``model evidence'' is used in model selection, by computing the probability of different models given the data:
% is used to determine the probability of different models, i.e. Model selection is determined from:
\begin{equation} \label{Model Selection}
Pr(M|D) = \frac{Pr(D|M)Pr(M)}{Pr(D)}
\end{equation}
where $Pr(M)$ is the ``model prior'', $Pr(D)$ is a normalization constant, and $Pr(M|D)$ is the ``model posterior''. The ratio of $Pr(M|D)$, known as the Bayes factor $(K)$, provides the relative probability of two models. 

\subsubsection{Application}

For clarity, we rewrite Equations \ref{Bayes Theorem}-\ref{Model Selection} for the specific case studied
\begin{equation} \label{Bayes Specific}
Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda) = \frac{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\epsilon,\sigma,\lambda)Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\lambda)}{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{Model Selection Specific}
Pr(\lambda|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}) = \frac{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)Pr(\lambda)}{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat})}
\end{equation}
where in this context $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ should be interpreted as an array of experimental data values. Notice that $\theta$ does not include $\lambda$, since we use $\lambda$ to distinguish between models. The ``model evidence'', $Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)$ in Equation \ref{Model Selection Specific}, for different values of $\lambda$ is determined by integrating the numerator of Equation \ref{Bayes Specific} for all values of $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$. 

%Note that if we instead sampled from the three-dimensional $(\epsilon, \sigma$, and $\lambda)$ distribution, Equation \ref{Bayes Specific} would be viewed as marginalizing with respect to $\lambda$.

%To calculate the evidence for different values of $\lambda$ based on VLE data Equation \ref{Model Selection} becomes:

(Note that if we instead sampled from the three-dimensional $(\epsilon, \sigma$, and $\lambda)$ distribution, this would be viewed as marginalizing with respect to $\lambda$.)

To compute the Bayes factor between two values of $\lambda$ 
%MRS2: added
(i.e. two different models, $M$), we assume that the prior evidence is equal for all values of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$, i.e. we use uniform distributions for $Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\lambda)$ in Equation \ref{Bayes Specific} and $Pr(\lambda)$ in Equation \ref{Model Selection Specific}. Due to the large amount of information contained in the data, $D$, the use of a uniform prior does not impact our results, i.e. the data ``swamps'' the prior.
%MRS2: need to discuss the justification for this choice, and whether it makes a difference. Also, are you literally making it uniform over an unbounded range, or a bounded range of reasonable values?  In practice, this can be equivalent to assuming the densities are zero outside the MCMC sampled region. Should justify the choice to not use other priors, i.e. jeffress, etc.
%RAM2: Basically it doesn't matter because we have so much data that is highly sensitive to rhol, Psat, etc.
The advantage of this assumption is that the Bayes factor, $K$, depends completely on the likelihood:
%MRS2: why quotation marks on ``likelihood''?
%RAM2: I guess I get a little quotation happy.
\begin{equation} \label{Bayes Factor}
K = \frac{ \int L(\epsilon,\sigma|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda_j) d\epsilon d\sigma}{ \int L(\epsilon,\sigma|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda_i) d\epsilon d\sigma}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_j$ are the different (fixed) values of $\lambda$ being compared.

%Note that $\theta$ does not include $\lambda$, since $\lambda$ is used as the distinction between models $(M)$. For clarity, we rewrite Bayes theorem for the specific case studied and use this notation moving forward
%\begin{equation} \label{Bayes Specific}
%Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda) = \frac{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\epsilon,\sigma,\lambda)Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\lambda)}{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)}
%\end{equation}
%where in this context $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ should be interpreted as an array of experimental data values.  

%Model selection is determined from:
%\begin{equation} \label{Model Selection}
%Pr(M|D) = \frac{Pr(D|M)Pr(M)}{Pr(D)}
%\end{equation}
%or in the specific case of calculating the evidence for different values of $\lambda$ based on VLE data Equation \ref{Model Selection} becomes:
%\begin{equation} \label{Model Selection Specific}
%Pr(\lambda|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}) = \frac{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)Pr(\lambda)}{Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat})}
%\end{equation}
%where the ``model evidence'', $Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)$ in Equation \ref{Model Selection Specific}, for different values of $\lambda$ is determined by integrating the numerator of Equation \ref{Bayes Specific} for all values of $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$. (Note that if we instead sampled from the three-dimensional $(\epsilon, \sigma$, and $\lambda)$ distribution, this would be viewed as marginalizing with respect to $\lambda$.)
%
%The ratio of $Pr(M|D)$, known as the Bayes factor $(K)$, provides the relative probability of two models (in this study, two values of $\lambda$). We assume that the ``prior'' evidence is equal for all values of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$, i.e. we use uniform distributions for $Pr(\lambda)$ in Equation \ref{Model Selection Specific} and $Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\lambda)$ in Equation \ref{Bayes Specific}. With this assumption, the Bayes factor depends completely on the ``likelihood'':
%\begin{equation} \label{Bayes Factor}
%K = \frac{ \int L(\epsilon,\sigma,|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda_j) d\epsilon d\sigma}{ \int L(\epsilon,\sigma,|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda_i) d\epsilon d\sigma}
%\end{equation}
%where $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_j$ are the different (fixed) values of $\lambda$ being compared.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
%MRS2: I don't know that you are supposed to have two ``conditional on'' | signs in one function. 
%RAM2: Ooops, fixed
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the traditional approach for numerically sampling from the probability distribution $Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)$. We use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to create a Markov Chain by proposing new $\epsilon$ or $\sigma$ values and accepting those moves based on the ratio of the probability between the previous parameter set and the proposed parameter set:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Acceptance}
\alpha = \min\left(1,\frac{Pr(\epsilon_{i+1},\sigma_{i+1}|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)\pi(\epsilon_{i+1},\sigma_{i+1}|\epsilon_i,\sigma_i,s_\epsilon,s_\sigma)}{Pr(\epsilon_i,\sigma_i|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)\pi(\epsilon_i,\sigma_i|\epsilon_{i+1},\sigma_{i+1},s_\epsilon,s_\sigma)}\right)
\end{equation} 
where $\alpha$ is the acceptance probability, $\epsilon_i$ and $\sigma_i$ are the previous parameter set, $\epsilon_{i+1}$ and $\sigma_{i+1}$ are the proposed parameter set, and $\pi$ is the sampling bi-variate normal distribution with mean equal to the previous $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ set and standard deviations of $s_\epsilon$ and $s_\sigma$. The amount to which $\epsilon$ or $\sigma$ is varied $(\Delta \epsilon$ and $\Delta \sigma)$ for each MCMC step depends on $s_\epsilon$ and $s_\sigma$. These parameters are tuned such that approximately $\frac{1}{3}$ of the moves are accepted. This ``tuning'' period (also referred to as a ``burn-in'' period) is followed by a production period where $s_\epsilon$ and $s_\sigma$ do not change. Since $\epsilon_{i+1}$ and $\sigma_{i+1}$ are highly correlated with $\epsilon_i$ and $\sigma_i$, it is important to ``thin'' the MCMC $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ parameter sets ($\epsilon_{\rm MCMC}$ and $\sigma_{\rm MCMC}$), i.e. every $j^{\rm th}$ parameter set is stored. Details for MCMC are provided in Supporting Information (i.e. number of steps for burn-in and production, frequency that step sizes are updated, resulting acceptance percentages, etc.).

%Since $\epsilon_{i+1}$ and $\sigma_{i+1}$ are highly correlated with $\epsilon_i$ and $\sigma_i$, we ``thin'' the $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ parameter sets.

%The parameter sets sampled from MCMC $(\epsilon_{\rm MCMC}$ and $\sigma_{\rm MCMC})$ provide an estimate of the uncertainty in $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ (see Figures \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_15_16_17_18_ethane} and \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_16_propane_butane_octane} in Section \ref{Results}). This parameter uncertainty propagates when estimating another property $(q)$ according to the expression:
%\begin{equation} \label{Posterior Prediction}
%Pr(q|D,M) = \int Pr(q|\theta,M) Pr(\theta|D,M) d\theta \approx \frac{1}{N_{\rm MCMC}} \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\rm MCMC}} Pr(q|\theta_{\rm MCMC, k},M)
%\end{equation}
%where 
%If $q$ was not included in $D$, which may or may not be included in $D$,


%according to the expression:
%\begin{equation} \label{Posterior Prediction}
%Pr(q|D,M) = \int Pr(q|\theta,M) Pr(\theta|D,M) d\theta \approx \frac{1}{N_{\rm MCMC}} \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\rm MCMC}} Pr(q|\theta_{\rm MCMC, k},M)
%\end{equation}

%MRS2: do you have a citation for this process? It's nonobvious to me. Is there a more Bayesian way of doing this? Do you need the histogram? Can't you just sample from the distribution as needed? Why does it have to be a represented as a histogram.
%RAM2: I did not mean to imply histograms. The 2-dimensional distribution of epsilon and sigma is not a histogram. I am now more specific when referencing the panels in the figures. I included the citation to Kulakova
This parameter uncertainty propagates when estimating another quantity of interest $(QoI)$, which may or may not be included in $D$, according to \cite{Kulakova2017}:
\begin{equation} \label{Posterior Prediction}
Pr(QoI|D,M) = \int Pr(QoI|\theta,M) Pr(\theta|D,M) d\theta \approx H\left(QoI(\theta_{\rm MCMC}|D,M)\right) \equiv H(QoI_{\rm MCMC})
\end{equation}
%MRS2: is there simulation error in this process? For example, is there any error computing property QoI given(\theta)? If so, aren't you including the uncertainty twice? (in the likelihood, then here). 
%RAM2: I don't believe I am double-counting. This is a well established approach taken from the literature. 
%MRS2: this is key part here that I'm a little uncertain on. Will need to be a bit more explaining, but may in part be my issues.
%RAM2: We can talk more about this  
%MRS2: I'm not 100% certain about the process here.  Likely correct, but citations to the process of generating distributions of QoI would probably be useful. The QoI(\theta) are generated in the course of the likelihood generation . . . seems like this is a completely indepenent part of the problem. 
%RAM2: I included a citation for Kulakova
where $H$ is a normalized histogram, $QoI(\theta_{\rm MCMC}|D,M)$ are the evaluated values of $QoI$ using the MCMC sampled parameter sets $(\theta_{\rm MCMC})$, and we adopt the more succinct notation $QoI_{\rm MCMC}$ to denote $QoI(\theta_{\rm MCMC}|D,M)$. From the histogram of $QoI_{\rm MCMC}$ values, standard statistical methods can be implemented to approximate the $QoI$ uncertainty at a desired credible level.

The $QoI$ considered in this study are VLE data, which are included in $D$, and $Z$ at high temperatures and pressures. For the specific case of propagating the parameter uncertainties ($\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ for a given $\lambda$) from $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ to $Z$, Equation \ref{Posterior Prediction} becomes:
\begin{equation} \label{Posterior Prediction Z}
Pr(Z|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda) \approx H\left(Z(\epsilon_{\rm MCMC},\sigma_{\rm MCMC}|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)\right) \equiv H(Z_{\rm MCMC})
\end{equation}
 

%To be more succinct, we adopt the notation $QoI_{\rm MCMC}$ to denote $QoI(\theta_{\rm MCMC}|D,M)

%although $D$ only consists of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, posterior prediction (Equation \ref{Posterior Prediction}) propagates the parameter uncertainties (from $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$) to $Z$ at high temperatures and pressures.


%by generating a histogram of $Z(\epsilon_{\rm MCMC},\sigma_{\rm MCMC})$. For example, the distribution of $Z$ is approximated from the MCMC samples using:
%%\begin{multline} \label{Posterior Prediction Z}
%%Pr(Z|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda) = \int Pr(Z|\epsilon,\sigma,\lambda) Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda) d\epsilon d\sigma \\ \approx \frac{1}{N_{\rm MCMC}} H\left(Z(\epsilon_{\rm MCMC},\sigma_{\rm MCMC}|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)\right)
%%\end{multline}
%where $H$ denotes a histogram of the $Z(\epsilon_{\rm MCMC},\sigma_{\rm MCMC}|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)$ values of $Z$ estimated for the MCMC sampled parameter sets ($\epsilon_{\rm MCMC}$ and $\sigma_{\rm MCMC}$), and $N_{\rm MCMC}$ is the number of MCMC moves sampled. A similar expression is possible for  From this distribution, which is typically represented as a histogram, standard statistical methods are implemented to approximate uncertainties at a 95\% credible level.  

%The probability distribution of $q$ $(Pr(q|D))$ is often approximated by developing a histogram of $q$ for the MCMC parameter sets, i.e. $q(\theta_{\rm MCMC})$. 

%Since a large number of MCMC samples are required for adequate representations of $Pr(\theta|D,M)$ and $Pr(QoI|D,M)$, MCMC is computationally infeasible when direct molecular simulation is required for every MCMC step. For this reason, we implement surrogate models to estimate $\rho_{\rm l, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$ and $Z_{\rm MCMC}$ (see Section \ref{Surrogate Model}).

For example, the uncertainties in $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ are determined using VLE proper In this study, $D$ consists of VLE properties ($\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, specifically) but the uncertainties in $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ 

 

% With MCMC it is not necessary to estimate $Pr(D)$ because MC moves are accepted based on the ratio of $Pr(\theta_i|D)$ and $Pr(\theta_{i+1}|D)$

Because MCMC moves are accepted based on Equation \ref{eq:Acceptance} and the denominator in Equation \ref{Bayes Specific} (i.e. $Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)$) does not depend on $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$, the acceptance probability is independent of $Pr(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}|\lambda)$. 
%MRS2: is uniform actually non-informative?  It has scale information (if there are ranges), which I think you may be implicitly including, unles the probability distributions are proven not to diverge when integrated over all sigma,epsilon.  This may confuse people since you say both non-informative and uniform.
%RAM2: I will get some feedback from the Bayesian people
Also, we use a ``weakly informative prior'' such that the acceptance probability is independent of $Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\lambda)$, although we do include a lower bound that the parameters are positive, i.e. $Pr(\epsilon,\sigma|\lambda)$ is uniform for all values of $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ greater than 0. Furthermore, $\pi$ is chosen to be symmetric such that the $\pi$ terms in the numerator and denominator of Equation \ref{eq:Acceptance} cancel. Therefore, the probability of accepting $\epsilon_{i+1}$ and $\sigma_{i+1}$ is based completely on the likelihood:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Acceptance Assumptions}
\alpha = \min\left(1,\frac{L(\epsilon_{i+1},\sigma_{i+1}|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)}{L(\epsilon_i,\sigma_i|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)}\right)
\end{equation} 
For this reason, we discuss in some detail how we calculate $L(\epsilon,\sigma,|\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat},P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat},\lambda)$.  


The likelihood is calculated using a normal distribution, $N(D, s^2_{\rm D,SM})$, where $s^2_{\rm D,SM}$ is the combined variance of the experimental data and the surrogate model used to estimate $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ for a given $\epsilon, \sigma$, and $\lambda$ (see Section \ref{Surrogate Model}). The variances 
are independent
% such 
meaning that the combined variance is the sum of the experimental and surrogate model variances, i.e. $s^2_{\rm D}$ and $s^2_{\rm SM}$ \cite{Bay_MD}. The experimental and surrogate model uncertainties $(u_{\rm D}$ and $u_{\rm SM}$, respectively$)$, are computed at the 95\% confidence level using the respective $s^2_{\rm D}$ and $s^2_{\rm SM}$ values. Figure \ref{fig:Error_model} compares the experimental data, $u_{\rm D}$, and $u_{\rm SM}$ for $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$. The experimental data and corresponding uncertainties are obtained through the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) ThermoData Engine (TDE) \cite{TDE}. Section \ref{Surrogate Model} discusses the key observation from this figure, namely, that the experimental uncertainties are negligible compared to the surrogate model uncertainties.

\subsection{Surrogate Model} \label{Surrogate Model}

A typical Markov Chain requires $O(10^4$--$10^5)$ Monte Carlo steps, where the likelihood function must be evaluated at each step. Since $L(\theta|D,M)$ depends on the force field parameters $(\epsilon, \sigma, $ and $\lambda)$, an MCMC approach is computationally infeasible if computing $L(\theta|D,M)$ requires performing direct molecular simulations for every proposed set of $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$. Furthermore, posterior predictive uncertainty propagation may require $O(10^2$--$10^3)$ $\theta_{\rm MCMC}$ parameter sets for adequate representations of $Pr(QoI|D,M)$ (see Equations \ref{Posterior Prediction}-\ref{Posterior Prediction Z}). For this reason, surrogate models are an essential tool for Bayesian numerical sampling methods, such as MCMC. Specifically, we implement surrogate models to estimate $\rho_{\rm l, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$ and $Z_{\rm MCMC}$. 

We use a configuration-sampling-based surrogate model, where configurations are sampled using a small group of reference parameter sets $(\epsilon_{\rm ref}, \sigma_{\rm ref}$, and $\lambda_{\rm ref})$ \cite{Postdoc_1}. As discussed in our previous study, we use a single value of $\epsilon_{\rm ref}$ with nine evenly spaced $\sigma_{\rm ref}$ values for a fixed value of $\lambda_{\rm ref}$. Ensemble averages for the MCMC parameter sets $(\theta_{\rm MCMC})$ are estimated by reweighting the sampled reference configurations using Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) \cite{shirts-chodera:jcp:2008:mbar}. 

The properties that are estimated using MBAR are the departure internal energy $(U^{\rm dep})$ and the compressibility factor $(Z)$. As discussed in Section \ref{Methods I}, Isothermal Isochoric Integration (ITIC) converts the MBAR estimated $U^{\rm dep}$ and $Z$ values at the 19 ITIC state points to saturation temperatures $(T^{\rm sat})$, saturated liquid densities $(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat})$ and saturated vapor pressures $(P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat})$. This is important since $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ are the data $(D)$ included in $L(\theta|D)$. Details for the implementation of MBAR and ITIC (MBAR-ITIC) is discussed elsewhere \cite{Postdoc_1}. 

The ITIC analysis provides VLE properties at only 5 saturation temperature values $(T^{\rm sat}_{\rm ITIC})$, while the experimental data set may have hundreds of saturation temperatures $(T^{\rm sat}_{\rm D})$. Although it is possible to use computed values from an empirical correlation fit to experimental data (i.e. REFPROP, ThermoData Engine (TDE)) as the data set, it is considered best practice for Bayesian inference that $D$ consist of raw experimental data.
% are preferred when performing a Bayesian analysis. 
%MRS2: this is a bit unclear.  You are using fitting the Antoine equation to the simulated ITIC to compare to experiment? Maybe make it a bit clearer. Is that error incorporated (i.e. it's not ONE set of Antoine equation parameters, but a family?) 
%RAM2: I modified the previous line and tried to make this statement a little more clear
For this reason, we instead use empirical model fits to interpolate the ITIC VLE properties $(\rho_{\rm l, ITIC}^{\rm sat})$ and $(P_{\rm v, ITIC}^{\rm sat})$ so that $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ can be estimated at any saturation temperature. Specifically, we fit $P_{\rm v, ITIC}^{\rm sat}$ and $T^{\rm sat}_{\rm ITIC}$ to the Antoine equation:
\begin{equation} \label{Antoine}
\log_{\rm 10}(P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}) = a_0 + \frac{a_1}{T^{\rm sat} + a_2}
\end{equation}
where $a_i$ are fitting parameters.
We fit $\rho_{\rm l, ITIC}^{\rm sat}$ and $T^{\rm sat}_{\rm ITIC}$ to a combined rectilinear and density scaling law expression \cite{Mess4}:
\begin{equation} \label{Rectilinear Scale}
\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat} = b_0 + b_1 (b_2 - T^{\rm sat}) + b_3 (b_2 - T^{\rm sat}) ^ {\beta}
\end{equation}
where $b_i$ are fitting parameters, and $\beta = 0.326$. $b_0$ and $b_2$ only provide rough estimates of the critical density $(\rho_c)$ and critical temperature $(T_c)$. More reliable estimates of the critical point require simultaneous fitting of $\rho_{\rm v, ITIC}^{\rm sat}$ to a similar expression, but this is unnecessary for our purposes since we are only including $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ in $D$. Note that Equations \ref{Antoine}-\ref{Rectilinear Scale} are only used to interpolate ITIC values, and not to extrapolate to higher or lower $T^{\rm sat}$. These equations appear to be reliable over the limited temperature range studied $(0.45 < T_{\rm r} < 0.85)$, whereas a wider temperature range would require more flexible models \cite{Riedel}. 

In summary, MBAR, ITIC, and Equations \ref{Antoine}-\ref{Rectilinear Scale} enable prediction of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ at any $T^{\rm sat}$ for any $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ by performing direct NVT simulations with only a few reference parameter sets. In addition, since the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is linear with respect to $r^{-6}$ and $r^{-\lambda}$ (see Equation \ref{eq:Mie}), we implement basis functions to efficiently recompute the energies and forces that are required for MBAR and ITIC (for details see Supporting Information of Reference \citenum{Postdoc_1} and Reference \citenum{naden:jctc:2016}).

In total, this methodology reduces the computational cost for computing $L(\theta|D)$ by several orders of magnitude compared to direct simulation of VLE, using Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) or Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) histogram reweighting (HR).

%, i.e. the standard deviation or variance due to the MBAR, ITIC, and Equations \ref{Antoine}-\ref{Rectilinear Scale} methodology, 
is essential for evaluating $L(\theta|D)$. Rather than performing a rigorous statistical assessment of MBAR, ITIC, and Equations \ref{Antoine}-\ref{Rectilinear Scale}, we use an empirical approach for estimating $s^2_{\rm SM}$. Specifically, we compute the deviation between the surrogate model estimates for $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ values for TraPPE and Potoff

with those reported in the literature for the respective force fields obtained using Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) or Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) histogram reweighting (HR). Although this is a rough approximation for estimating $s^2_{\rm SM}$, this comparison has the added benefit that it incorporates possible deviations associated with the simulation package, and post-simulation analysis, which can be significant \cite{RoundRobin}.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Error_model}, the surrogate model uncertainty $(u_{\rm SM}$, reported at the 95\% confidence level) for $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ is 0.3\% up to $0.75 T_c$ and increases linearly to 1.5\% at the maximum $T^{\rm sat}$. The surrogate model uncertainty for $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ is 20\% at the minimum $T_{\rm sat}$ and decreases linearly to 7\% at $0.6 T_c$, where it remains constant for higher temperatures. Note that these are conservative estimates of $u_{\rm SM}$, where other studies suggest ITIC can have significantly smaller uncertainties \cite{Mostafa_Diss}. In fact, for the compounds investigated in this study, these uncertainties are much larger than the experimental uncertainties $(u_{\rm D})$ and, therefore, the size of the parameter space sampled by MCMC depends almost entirely on $u_{\rm SM}$. The use of a conservative $u_{\rm SM}$ model is intentional in this regard, namely, so that the $\theta_{\rm MCMC}$ sampled points represent the only feasible values of $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ for optimizing $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$.

%MRS2: how hard would it be to do the full 4 parameter model?  I'm guessing it's because doing all the basis functions is harder?  Maybe be more explicit as to 1) the cost and 2) why you think it doesn't matter (i.e. it's OK to force the other models to use ethane parameters).  From my perspective, the difference between the 4 parameter and 2,2 parameter model is extremely interesting and may show us when we get results we don't expect. 
%RAM2: It would not be too difficult, but I don't think it is necessary considering the primary purpose of this text. 
In this section, we use MCMC and the aforementioned surrogate models to determine the parameter uncertainty in CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ interaction sites of \textit{n}-alkanes. Since the common practice is to limit $\lambda$ to integer values (see Section \ref{Force Field}), we perform several independent MCMC runs using a single, fixed, integer value of $\lambda$. The Bayesian inference analysis for CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ sites is performed sequentially. Specifically, rather than sampling from a four-dimensional parameter space (i.e. $\epsilon_{\rm CH_3}$, $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$, $\sigma_{\rm CH_3}$, and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ for a given value of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$ and $\lambda_{\rm CH_2}$), we implement a sequential two-dimensional approach by assuming the CH$_3$ parameters from ethane are transferable to propane, \textit{n}-butane, and \textit{n}-octane. 

%As mentioned in Section \ref{Force Field}, it is common to limit $\lambda$ to integer values. 
%MRS2: Is the next section needed?  If there are only a few choices of lambda that are reasonable, just treating them as separate models seems to be fine. You don't need to justify not doing MCMC between models, I don't think.
%RAM2: Hopefully the new version is clearer
%Due to the strong correlation between $\epsilon$ and $\lambda$, advanced sampling methods would be required to achieve good acceptance ratios when sampling from discrete values of $\lambda$. For this reason, we perform several independent MCMC runs using fixed values of $\lambda$. This approach is computationally more efficient since we are only concerned with a few values of $\lambda$ (i.e. $12$-$18$).    
%MRS2: the only thing that is needed if you can't jump between lambda-labeled distributions/models is explicitly calculate the normalizing constant between them, which I think you can do with explicit integration (though we will need to check that is done correctly).  I think it should be P(lambda|D)?
%RAM2: This is what we do to compute the Bayes factor
\subsection{Ethane} \label{Ethane}

%MRS2: here's a thought.  I think most of this paragraph actually should go in the caption (it should still start with a thesis sentence!). Right now, the figure isn't self contained.  I think it would read smoother if the TEXT focused on interpretationand analysis of the figures (what does it mean?) and the caption focused on what the data was. 
%RAM2: I agree. Most of this was originally in the caption, but I have been trying to shorten my figure captions.

Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_13_14_15_16_17_18_ethane} presents the MCMC results for ethane with $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} =13$-$18$. Panel a) in Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_13_14_15_16_17_18_ethane} demonstrates that the feasible region of $\epsilon_{\rm CH_3}$ depends strongly on $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$, namely, larger values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$ require larger values of $\epsilon_{\rm CH_3}$. By contrast, we observe a much smaller shift towards larger values of $\sigma_{\rm CH_3}$ with increasing $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$. This observation is consistent with the literature \cite{Mie}.

%Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_13_14_15_16_17_18_ethane} presents the MCMC results for ethane with $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} =13$-$18$. Panel a) plots the MCMC sampled parameter sets for different values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$ ($\epsilon_{\rm CH_3, MCMC}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_3, MCMC}$). The inset of Panel a) plots the mean absolute percent deviation (MAPD\%) of the MCMC predicted VLE properties ($\rho_{\rm l, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$). Panels b) and d) plot the percent deviation from REFPROP correlations for $\rho_{\rm l, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$, respectively. Specifically, the upper and lower lines correspond to the uncertainty for each $\lambda$, which are determined at the 95\% credible level. The insets of Panels b) and d) are histograms of the MAPD\% in $\rho_{\rm l, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$, respectively. Panel c) plots $Z$ with respect to inverse temperature for the two highest isochores $(\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ in Panel a) of Figure \ref{fig:IC_normal_alkanes}). The inset of Panel c) plots the distribution of average deviation (AD\%) in pressure for the two highest densities along the supercritical isotherm $(P^{\rm high})$. The AD\% is chosen to demonstrate the positive bias in $P^{\rm high}$, while the MAPD\% is used when quantifying the goodness of fit in VLE data.
%MRS2: I'm having a hard time processing the entire figure, since it really is 8 figures in one.   Is there a good way to split it into 2? Obvously b and d go together well.  Perhaps a and c should be a separate figure? Too much information in too small a space.
%RAM2: I was considering this also. I combined this all into one figure because all of the data are closely related.
%Panel a) plots the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets for the different values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$. The inset of Panel a) plots the AD\% of $\rho_{\rm l, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v, MCMC}^{\rm sat}$.

%MRS: suggest breaking up important points to separate paragraphs.

The results depicted in Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_13_14_15_16_17_18_ethane} are useful for comparing the performance of different values of $\lambda$. Note that the insets in Panels a), b), and d) plot the mean absolute percent deviation (MAPD\%) to quantify the goodness of fit to VLE data, while the inset in Panel c) plots the average deviation (AD\%) to demonstrate the positive bias in $P^{\rm high}$.

Panel b) with the corresponding inset demonstrates that the best prediction of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ is obtained for higher values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$. However, while the $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ MAPD\% for $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 15$--$18$ are similar, $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 13$--$14$ have significantly higher $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ MAPD\%. 

Panel d) demonstrates that $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 13$--$14$ and $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 17$--$18$ over- and under-predict $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ at low temperatures, respectively, 
%MRS2: eyeballing, 14 looks consistent to me.  What quantitive measure can you use for what it means to over or underpredict?
%RAM2: The MAPD histogram is intended to quantify this statement. Also, I just realized that I had an error in panels b,c, and d. Specifically, the errorbars and uncertainty regions represented the estimated 100% confidence region, i.e. all of the MCMC sampled values. I have now converted these to the 95% credible regions by integrating the histograms with equal areas. The results are much more conclusive now.
while $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 15$--$16$ are the most reliable. $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 15$ has the least amount of bias and the lowest MAPD\% in $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ (see inset). 

The inset of Panel a), helps to visualize the overall performance of different values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$. 
%MRS2: be more precise about noticing the pareto front.  You mean in Panel a?) Can you draw a line indicating it? Some people might not have a sense of what they would be looking for.
Notice the trade-off between the MAPD\% of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$. This compromise between two competing properties included in the objective function, namely, $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, is known as a Pareto front \cite{Pareto_Deriv,Pareto_LJPQ,Pareto_ST}. The optimal location for a Pareto front is the bottom left region of the plot (low MAPD\% for both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$) while the worst location is the top right region (high MAPD\% for both $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$). By comparing the Pareto fronts for different values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$, $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 15$ or $16$ are the optimal choice, depending on whether $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ or $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ has a greater weight.

% A Pareto front represents a compromise between the MAPD\% of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ two competing contributions to the objective function. 

%Notice the trade-off, i.e. the Pareto front, between the two properties included in the objective function, namely, $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ \cite{Pareto_Deriv,Pareto_LJPQ,Pareto_ST}. A Pareto front represents a compromise between the MAPD\% of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ two competing contributions to the objective function. 

%Consistent with the insets of Panels b) and d), the 15-6 potential has the lowest MAPD\% in $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, while the 16-6, 17-6, and 18-6 have slightly lower MAPD\% in $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and the 13-6 and 14-6 have significantly higher MAPD for $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$.

Finally, and most importantly, Panel c) demonstrates that all of the sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_3, MCMC}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_3, MCMC}$ parameter sets for $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} \ge 14$ over-predict $Z$ at high temperatures and densities $(P^{\rm high})$. As expected, the larger the value of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$, the 
more 
%greater 
the force field over-predicts $P^{\rm high}$. For example, although $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 15$ and $16$ are the best values based on VLE data, they over-predict $P^{\rm high}$ by around 10 and 15\%, respectively. This supports the fundamental claim of this manuscript, namely, that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential cannot adequately predict both VLE and high pressures for supercritical fluids and compressed liquids.  

While $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 13$ is quite reliable for $P^{\rm high}$, it performs significantly worse for VLE. The Bayes factor, based on VLE data, quantifies the evidence for different values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$. Figure \ref{fig:Bayes_Factors} shows that for ethane the UA Mie 15-6 and 16-6 potentials are equally justified while the evidence for 14-6 and 17-6 is much less and the evidence for 13-6 and 18-6 is negligible. 

%Note that the values in Figure \ref{fig:Bayes_Factors} have been normalized by the 14-6 potential.

% The same is true for the 14-6 potential, which has a 5 AD\% in $P^{\rm high}$  
%While the 14-6 potential only demonstrates a 5\% disagreement in $P^{\rm high}$ (notice that the REFPROP deviation is only 1\%), the deprecation in the quality of VLE is significant. This can be quantified by determining the Bayes factor for different values of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$ (normalized by the 14-6 potential). Table \ref{tab:Bayes_Factors} shows that for ethane the 15-6 and 16-6 potentials are equally justified while the evidence for 14-6 and 17-6 is much less and the evidence for 18-6 is negligible.

The Bayes factors in Figure \ref{fig:Bayes_Factors} are conclusive evidence that the 13-6 potential is not justified based on ethane VLE data. By contrast, the evidence in favor of the 15-6 and 16-6 potentials over the 14-6 potential is not as definitive, since a Bayes factor around 4 is typically not considered substantial evidence. However, these values depend strongly on the VLE data and the error model used to compute $L(\theta|D)$. We use a very conservative error model for $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ (see Figure BLANK) so that our MCMC results represent the entire range of feasible parameters. This is done primarily to prove conclusively that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 is inadequate for predicting VLE and $P^{\rm high}$. However, a less conservative error model would provide more convincing evidence regarding the optimal $\lambda$ based solely on VLE data. 

Also, recall that ITIC is limited to $T^{\rm sat} < 0.85 T_c$. Therefore, it is possible that the optimal value of $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$ could be deduced (i.e. larger Bayes factors) if higher temperature VLE data were included (say from 260--290 K). Based on the observed bias in $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ at higher temperatures (240--260 K) for $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = 14$, it appears that higher temperature VLE data would strengthen the counter evidence against the 14-6 potential. It is unclear whether higher temperature data would support the 15-6 or 16-6 potential, likely the optimal $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$ is a non-integer value between 15 and 16.

\subsection{Larger \textit{n}-alkanes} \label{Larger_nalkanes}

%MRS2: would be really good to have strong theses here. Saying ``Here's a bunch of information'' makes it hard to read the paper.  STate a thesis, then support it with data.  Again, maybe this should be in the caption after the statement of what the graph is showing.

This section demonstrates that the conclusions regarding the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential for ethane are general for larger \textit{n}-alkanes. Specifically, we observe that improved accuracy in predicting VLE requires a larger value of $\lambda_{\rm CH_2}$. However, this improvement comes at the cost of significantly over-predicting $P^{\rm high}$. Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_16_propane_butane_octane} presents the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets with Panels a) and b) corresponding to $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 16$ and $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 14$, respectively. Note that these results were obtained using fixed values of $\epsilon_{\rm CH_3}$, $\sigma_{\rm CH_3}$, and $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$, where $\lambda_{\rm CH_3} = \lambda_{\rm CH_2}$. The values of $\epsilon_{\rm CH_3}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_3}$ are the maximum likelihood parameter set from ethane for the corresponding $\lambda_{\rm CH_3}$ value.

%Panel a) contains the MCMC parameter sets for propane, \textit{n}-butane, and \textit{n}-octane, while Panel b) contains results for propane and \textit{n}-butane. Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_16_propane_butane_octane} also includes contours of the average percent deviations (AD\%) in $P^{\rm high}$ ($T=T^{IT}$ and $\rho = \rho_3$ or $\rho_4$) relative to the REFPROP correlations. The ``REFPROP uncertainty'' region corresponds to AD\% of $\pm 1$.

%Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie16_propane_butane_octane} presents the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets with $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 16$. Notice that the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets overlap considerably for propane, \textit{n}-butane, and \textit{n}-octane. This supports the common assumption of transferability of CH$_2$ parameters between different \textit{n}-alkanes. Note that the uncertainty in the parameters is largest for propane and smallest for \textit{n}-octane. This suggests that, as expected, the sensitivity of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ with respect to the CH$_2$ parameters increases with increasing number of CH$_2$ interaction sites. Also, notice that the Potoff parameter set is within the MCMC sample region. More importantly, for the purposes of this manuscript, the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets have $P^{\rm high}$ AAD\% $\approx 16$-$23$, while the REFPROP uncertainty in $P^{\rm high}$ is estimated to be around $1$\%.

%\end{figure}

Notice in Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_16_propane_butane_octane} that the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets, for a given value of $\lambda_{\rm CH_2}$, overlap considerably for propane, \textit{n}-butane, and \textit{n}-octane. This provides statistical evidence to support the common assumption of transferability of CH$_2$ parameters between different \textit{n}-alkanes. 

Panel a) shows that the Potoff CH$_2$ parameter set is within the MCMC sample region for $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 16$. The same result was also observed for ethane (see Panel a) of Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_13_14_15_16_17_18_ethane}). This suggests that the Potoff CH$_3$ and CH$_2$ parameters are supported by the VLE data used in this study, although the Potoff force field was parameterized using VLE data in a higher temperature range $(0.6 < T_{\rm r}^{\rm sat} < 0.95)$. 
%MRS2: ``likely parameter sets'' or ``parameter sets supported by data''?
%RAM2: Done
%feasible parameter sets.

Also, note that the uncertainty in the parameters is largest for propane and smallest for \textit{n}-octane. This suggests that the sensitivity of $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, with respect to the CH$_2$ parameters, increases with increasing number of CH$_2$ interaction sites. Although this result is fairly intuitive, it is a valuable insight when selecting a training set of molecules for force field development.

For the purposes of this manuscript, it is important to focus on the contours in Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_16_propane_butane_octane}, which correspond to AD\% in $P^{\rm high}$. Notice that the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets have a strong positive bias (i.e. large AD\%) in $P^{\rm high}$. Specifically, $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 16$ and $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 14$ have, respectively, AD\% of $\approx 16$-$21$ and $\approx 10$-$15$, much greater than the REFPROP uncertainty of around $1$\%. It is interesting that, for corresponding values of $\lambda$, the AD\% for these larger \textit{n}-alkanes is higher than that of ethane. This suggests that longer chain-lengths, with a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field, exacerbate the erroneous $PVT$ trend at high pressures.

% for the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential   

Although the AD\% in $P^{\rm high}$ is slightly lower for $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 14$ than for $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 16$, the UA Mie 14-6 potential is significantly less reliable for VLE. Figure \ref{fig:Bayes_Factors} demonstrates the strong evidence, based on VLE data, for $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 16$ over $\lambda_{\rm CH_2} = 14$. 
%MRS2: sentences shouldn't be parenthetical.
%RAM2: Done
Note that the evidence in Figure \ref{fig:Bayes_Factors} for CH$_2$ is likely stronger than CH$_3$ because VLE data from more than one compound were included.
Furthermore, because the ``REFPROP uncertainty'' contours are roughly parallel to the MCMC region and found at much lower $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ values, it is necessary to sacrifice considerable accuracy in $\rho_{\rm l}^{sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ in order to accurately predict $P^{\rm high}$. 
In conclusion, these results suggest that neither UA Mie 16-6 or 14-6 force fields are capable of predicting VLE and $PVT$ for supercritical fluids and compressed liquids of \textit{n}-alkanes. 

%Therefore, considering the deprecation in VLE, the marginal gain in accuracy for $P^{\rm high}$ does not merit using a UA Mie 14-6 potential.

% Therefore, Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie_14_16_propane_butane_octane} provides convincing evidence that, regardless of the value of $\lambda$, the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 model is not capable of predicting both VLE and $PVT$ at high pressures.

%The REFPROP uncertainty region that corresponds to AAD\% of $\pm 1$ is parallel to the MCMC region and found at much lower $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ (around 45 K for the same $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$). Therefore, in order to accurately predict $P^{\rm high}$, it is necessary to sacrifice accuracy in $\rho_{\rm l}^{sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$. Figures \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie16_propane_butane_octane}-\ref{fig:MCMC_Mie14_propane_butane} provide convincing evidence that, regardless of the value of $\lambda$, the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 model is not capable of predicting both VLE and $PVT$ at high pressures.

%Also, notice that the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets overlap considerably for the two compounds. In other words, the $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets for propane and \textit{n}-butane are indistinguishable to within uncertainty. This supports the common assumption of transferability of CH$_2$ parameters between different \textit{n}-alkanes.

%Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie16_propane_butane_octane} suggests that the UA Mie 16-6 potential is not capable of predicting VLE and $PVT$ for supercritical fluids and compressed liquids of propane, \textit{n}-butane, and \textit{n}-octane. Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie14_propane_butane} demonstrates that the UA Mie 14-6 potential is also not capable of predicting both properties for propane and \textit{n}-butane. Specifically, all of the MCMC sampled $\epsilon_{\rm CH_2}$ and $\sigma_{\rm CH_2}$ parameter sets in Figure \ref{fig:MCMC_Mie14_propane_butane} have $P^{\rm high}$ AAD\% $\approx 10$-$15$. Although this is improvement relative to the UA Mie 16-6 AAD\%, recall that the UA Mie 14-6 is less reliable for VLE. Therefore, considering the significant deprecation in VLE, the marginal gain in accuracy for $P^{\rm high}$ likely does not merit using a UA Mie 14-6 potential.

\subsection{Recommendations} \label{Recommendations}

The Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is capable of reproducing $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ for $\lambda = 15$ or $16$. However, this improved accuracy does not appear to have physical/theoretical justification. For this reason, $\lambda$ values greater than $13$ over-predict pressures for supercritical fluids and compressed liquids. Therefore, for developing FEOS of normal and branched alkanes, we 
%MRS2: can you recommended them if you didn't run them?  Perhaps something like ``further investigation should look at alternative . . . ``
%RAM2: Done
recommend further investigation of alternative potentials with a softer repulsive barrier and a more sound theoretical basis, e.g. Buckingham exponential-6, Morse \cite{Rowley1999,Rowley2001,Hayes2004}, or an extended Lennard-Jones \cite{Mostafa_Diss,Hajigeorgiou2016,Kalos1972}.

Although the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is not quantitatively reliable at high pressures, it may still be of use for FEOS parameterization when considering the insight gained in this study. For example, since the Potoff force field consistently over-predicts high pressures, a non-linear FEOS optimization could utilize the simulation results as an upper constraint for the FEOS pressure \cite{Thol_LJTS}. Furthermore, the primary purpose to include molecular simulation data for FEOS development is to increase the range of validity by ensuring good behavior of the FEOS at high temperatures and pressures. While FEOS are based on empirical equations with 10--30 fitting parameters, even an inaccurate force field has a more sound theoretical basis and, therefore, the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 simulation output for a given property should not demonstrate non-physical oscillations, inflection points, derivative sign-changes, etc., which can plague a poorly-fit FEOS.

%
% Despite the systematic deviations at high pressures, the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 results should not diverge . 

%The primary purpose to include molecular simulation data for FEOS development is to increase the range of validity by ensuring good behavior of the FEOS at high temperatures and pressures.

Essentially, whether or not a FEOS should be developed using a hybrid data set consisting of UA Mie $\lambda$-6 simulation results depends on the quality and quantity of available experimental data. If the data cover a wide range of state points and properties, it is possible that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential may still be useful, despite the systematic deviations at high pressures. By contrast, if the experimental data are limited such that the FEOS depends almost entirely on the molecular simulation results, the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field will lead to large deviations at high pressures. 

% It remains to be seen if the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential can still provide a reasonable trend, despite the systematic deviations at high pressures, to help keep the FEOS from diverging.  

%Thus, despite our findings that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is not quantitatively reliable at high pressures, it remains to be seen if this potential can be used in a hybrid data set.

The primary purpose to include molecular simulation data for FEOS development is to increase the range of validity by ensuring good behavior of the FEOS at high temperatures and pressures. Therefore, although the Mie 16-6 over-predicts pressure, it still provides a reasonable trend to help keep the FEOS from diverging. In addition, since the Mie 16-6 potential consistently over-predicts pressure, it is possible to use the simulation results as an upper constraint. 

\subsection{Limitations} \label{Limitations}

%MRS2: the purpose of this section is not too clear.
%RAM2: Included a sentence to explain why this is important
%The simulation values that are typically included in hybrid data sets are derivatives of the residual Helmholtz free energy $(\partial^n a^{\rm r})$ with respect to inverse temperature and/or density \cite{Thol2016_siloxane_first,Thol2016_siloxane,Thol2017}, while in this study we simply compare the $PVT$ behavior. Aside from the advantage of simplicity (most simulation packages do not provide $\partial^n a^{\rm r}$), this choice is based on the fact that $PVT$ is more readily understood and easier to visualize. In other words, it is easier to quantify the impact on process design caused by deviations in $PVT$ behavior than derivatives in the residual Helmholtz free energy. Furthermore, as demonstrated by Thol et al., an inaccurate prediction of some $\partial^n a^{\rm r}$ does not necessarily result in poor prediction of $PVT$ behavior or heat capacities \cite{Thol2016_siloxane_first}. 
%
%It is important to remember that $Z$ depends only on the first derivative of Helmholtz free energy with respect to density. $U^{\rm dep}$ is linearly dependent on the first derivative of residual Helmholtz free energy with respect to inverse temperature. From our analysis we also observed some systematic bias in $U^{\rm dep}$ at high pressures. Unfortunately, deficiencies in the $U^{\rm dep}$ trends are not as obvious due to the relatively large uncertainties in the REFPROP correlations, ca. 5\%. While $Z$ and $U^{\rm dep}$ directly impact FEOS parameterization, this study does not assess the quality of the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential for the other four derivatives. Therefore, future work should investigate the adequacy of force fields to predict heat capacities, which depend on temperature derivatives, at higher temperatures and pressures. Rigorous studies of this type have been performed on the single-site Lennard-Jones fluid \cite{Thol2016_LJ,Thol_LJTS,Rutkai2017}. 
%
%We would like to emphasize that, although we did not use $\partial^n a^{\rm r}$ for our analysis, including higher order derivatives of the residual Helmholtz free energy from molecular simulation has significant advantages for developing FEOS as it eliminates redundant information found in traditional macroscopic properties \cite{Thol2016_LJ,Thol_LJTS,Rutkai2017,Lustig2015,Rutkai2013,Rutkai2015}. Since $Z$ and $U^{\rm dep}$ depend on only a single derivative and are readily available for most simulation packages, we chose to investigate these properties.

This section discusses limitations to the primary conclusion from this study, namely, that UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force fields parameterized with VLE data should not be used to develop fundamental equations of state for normal and branched alkanes. The main limitation is that the poor extrapolation at high pressures is based solely on the trend of $Z$ with respect to inverse temperature. By contrast, the simulation values that are typically included in hybrid data sets are derivatives of the residual (or departure) Helmholtz free energy with respect to inverse temperature and/or density \cite{Thol2016_siloxane_first,Thol2016_siloxane,Thol2017,Rutkai2013,Thol2015}:
\begin{equation} \label{Residual Derivatives}
A_{xy}^{\rm dep} R_gT \equiv (1/T)^x\rho^y \frac{\partial^{x+y}A^{\rm dep}}{\partial(1/T)^x \partial \rho^y}
\end{equation}
We would like to emphasize the advantage of using $A_{xy}^{\rm dep}$ for developing FEOS, as this approach eliminates redundant information found in traditional macroscopic properties \cite{Thol2016_LJ,Rutkai2017,Lustig2015,Rutkai2013,Rutkai2015}. For example, the following expressions demonstrate the interdependency of the properties we computed, namely, $Z$ and $U^{\rm dep}$ with their derivatives along isochores and isotherms \cite{Rutkai2015}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Z}
Z = 1 + A_{01}^{\rm dep}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Z_IC}
\frac{1}{T} \left(\frac{-\partial Z}{\partial(1/T)}\right)_\rho = 1 + A_{01}^{\rm dep} - A_{11}^{\rm dep}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:U}
\frac{U^{\rm dep}}{R_gT} = A_{10}^{\rm dep}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:U_IC}
\frac{1}{R_g} \left(\frac{\partial U^{\rm dep}}{\partial T}\right)_\rho = -A_{20}^{\rm dep} 
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Z_IT}
\rho \left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial \rho}\right)_T = 1 + 2 A_{01}^{\rm dep} + A_{02}^{\rm dep} 
\end{equation}
Unfortunately, with the exception of \textit{ms2} \cite{ms2}, we are not aware of any open-source simulation packages that readily provide $A_{xy}^{\rm dep}$. 
%MRS2: this is something we can set up relatively easily for OpenFF (along with the similar derivatives for NPT), and perhapsshould.  Owen has been working along these lines.
%RAM2: I assume you mean OpenMM?

In addition, macroscopic properties, such as $Z$ and $U^{\rm dep}$ (with their respective derivatives), are more readily understood and visualized than $A_{xy}^{\rm dep}$. Also, it is easier to quantify their impact on process design than derivatives in the residual Helmholtz free energy. For example, as demonstrated by Thol et al., an inaccurate prediction of some $A_{xy}^{\rm dep}$ does not necessarily result in poor prediction of $PVT$ behavior or heat capacities \cite{Thol2016_siloxane_first}. For these reasons, we did not base our conclusions on the adequacy of the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential to predict $A_{xy}^{\rm dep}$.

Instead, we have presented $Z$ and, by inspection, the slope of $Z$ with respect to $1/T$ at constant $\rho$. Since these properties are equivalent to Equations \ref{eq:Z}-\ref{eq:Z_IC}, respectively, we have indirectly focused on only two of the Helmholtz derivatives, namely, $A_{01}^{\rm dep}$ and $A_{11}^{\rm dep}$. However, we also observed some deviations in $U^{\rm dep}$, the slope of $U^{\rm dep}$ with respect to $T$ at constant $\rho$, and the slope of $Z$ with respect to $\rho$ at constant $T$, which are equivalent to Equations \ref{eq:U}-\ref{eq:Z_IT}. Unfortunately, deficiencies are not as obvious for these properties due to the relatively large uncertainties in the REFPROP correlations, ca. 5\% and 10\% for $U^{\rm dep}$ and $\left(\frac{\partial U^{\rm dep}}{R_g \partial T}\right)_\rho$. Although these additional properties provide insight regarding $A_{10}^{\rm dep}$, $A_{20}^{\rm dep}$, and $A_{02}^{\rm dep}$, because the results are less conclusive they are provided only as Supporting Information. Furthermore, the relationship between Equations \ref{eq:U}-\ref{eq:Z_IT} and the repulsive barrier, $\lambda$, is not obvious. By contrast, the observation that larger values of $\lambda$ over-predict $Z$ with increasing temperature is clear evidence that $\lambda > 12$ is not theoretically justified but, rather, is an empirical remedy that performs well for VLE.

Future work should investigate more thoroughly the adequacy of UA Mie $\lambda$-6 (or other) force fields to predict $U^{\rm dep}$ and isochoric/isobaric heat capacities at high temperatures and pressures. For example, rigorous studies of this type have been performed on the single-site Lennard-Jones fluid \cite{Thol2016_LJ,Thol_LJTS,Rutkai2017}.  

Another limitation is that we utilize a single layer Bayes model as opposed to a hierarchical model \cite{Kulakova2017,Wu2016}. Wu et al. demonstrated that it is important to use hierarchical models when there are discrepancies in the data set, $D$. Fortunately, since we use a conservative estimate for the surrogate model uncertainty, i.e. $u_{\rm SM} \gg u_{\rm D}$, any discrepancies in the VLE data should not affect the parameter uncertainties. 

The hierarchical approach is also useful when accounting for model inadequacies, i.e. when the force field is not capable of representing multiple data types. A hierarchical method should thus be favored if determining the parameter uncertainty when simultaneously considering $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ and $P^{\rm high}$. Furthermore, a hierarchical model should be used if the parameters are not transferable between molecules, i.e. if the CH$_2$ parameters were different for propane, \textit{n}-butane, and \textit{n}-octane. However, the hierarchical approach is unnecessary for our purposes, since the transferable UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field for \textit{n}-alkanes is capable of reproducing $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, which are the only properties included in $D$. In addition, hierarchical Bayesian models can be considerably more expensive computationally than a single layer model.

%The posterior propagation of uncertainty to $P^{\rm high}$ does not require.

%the purpose of this study is to demonstrate that, for all feasible parameter sets obtained from VLE properties, a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field is inaccurate for $P^{\rm high}$. Therefore, since we focus on the parameter uncertainty obtained from just $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$ and $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$, the hierarchical approach is unnecessary. In addition, hierarchical Bayesian models can be considerably more expensive computationally than a single layer model. 

%For these reasons, we utilized a single layer model to demonstrate that, for all feasible parameter sets obtained from VLE properties, a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field is inaccurate for $P^{\rm high}$.

%However, the purpose of this study is to demonstrate that, for all feasible parameter sets obtained from VLE properties, a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field is inaccurate for $P^{\rm high}$. 

%However, hierarchical models are not necessary to show that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is not capable of accurately predicting all three properties ($\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ and $P^{\rm high}$). Notice that we only included VLE data in our single layer Bayes model because the purpose of this study is to demonstrate that, for all feasible parameter sets obtained from VLE properties, a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field is inaccurate for $P^{\rm high}$. In addition, hierarchical Bayesian models are considerably more expensive computationally. For these reasons, we utilized the single layer Bayes methodology.

%Another limitation is that we utilize a single layer Bayes model as opposed to a hierarchical model \cite{Kulakova2017,Wu2016}. Wu et al. demonstrated that hierarchical models provide parameter uncertainties that more rigorously account for discrepancies in experimental data. Since $u_{\rm c} \gg u_{\rm exp}$, any discrepancies in the VLE data should not affect the parameter uncertainties. More importantly, the hierarchical approach is also useful when accounting for model inadequacies, i.e. when the force field is not capable of representing multiple data types. Therefore, the hierarchical method could determine the parameter uncertainty when simultaneously considering $\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ and $P^{\rm high}$. However, the purpose of this study is to demonstrate that, for all feasible parameter sets obtained from VLE properties, a UA Mie $\lambda$-6 force field over-predicts $P^{\rm high}$. In other words, hierarchical models are not necessary to show that no $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\lambda$ set exists that is capable of accurately predicting all three properties ($\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}$, $P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}$ and $P^{\rm high}$). Furthermore, hierarchical Bayesian models are considerably more expensive computationally and were, therefore, not included in this study.

Wu et al. demonstrated that hierarchical models can provide parameter uncertainties that more rigorously account for discrepancies in experimental data. Since $u_{\rm c} \gg u_{\rm exp}$, any discrepancies in the VLE data were non-consequential. Having said that, the hierarchical approach is useful when accounting for model inadequacies, i.e. when the force field is not capable of representing multiple data types.

\section{Conclusions} \label{Conclusions}

Recently, molecular simulation results at extreme temperatures and pressures have been used to supplement experimental data when developing fundamental equations of state for compounds with limited experimental data. For this hybrid data set approach to work, it is imperative that the force field be reliable and transferable over different $PVT$ conditions. Unfortunately, literature united-atom force fields that are highly accurate for estimating VLE properties of normal and branched alkanes have systematic deviations in $Z$ at non-VLE conditions. Bayesian inference suggests that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 model type is not adequate for simultaneously predicting saturated liquid density, vapor pressure, and $Z$ at high pressures. In the case of ethane, evidence from VLE data supports $14 \le \lambda \le 17$, while $Z$ at high pressures requires $\lambda = 13$. A similar trend is observed for larger \textit{n}-alkanes. Specifically, evidence from VLE data supports $\lambda = 16$, while we observe slight improvement in $Z$ at high pressures for $\lambda = 14$. Therefore, while considerable improvement in VLE is observed for $\lambda > 12$, the use of UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials over the traditional UA Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential appears to be more empirical than theoretical. For these reasons, we recommend that alternative models be considered for developing FEOS of normal and branched alkanes, such as force fields that use anisotropic-united-atom, all-atom, and/or alternative non-bonded potentials.

%%	\item Although the UA Mie potential provides great improvement over the UA LJ 12-6 potential for VLE, it drastically over-predicts pressures for supercritical fluids and compressed liquids (actually for supercritical fluids it over-predicts at high densities and under-predicts at low densities.

%\end{enumerate}

%%% This was taken from previous drafts of the first manuscript. These paragraphs will probably not go in this manuscript.
%%%% The next few paragraphs probably belong in Part II where we focus on parameterization. I think it suffices in this paper to just say that we need surrogate models for computational reasons.

%%% Some of this discussion actually belongs in the publication that I do with Elliott and Potoff most likely

%The increase in the number of model parameters causes the parameterization to be more difficult, especially when direct molecular simulations are required. For example, the Mie $\lambda$-6 parameters reported by Potoff are obtained by scanning the parameter space using predefined grid spacing. Although this scanning approach is useful for verifying that a global minimum is found, it scales as $O(n_g^{n_p})$ where $n_g$ is the number of grid points per $n_p$ and $n_p$ is the number of parameters. With $n_g \approx 30$ performing molecular simulations at each grid point becomes computationally intractable for $n_p > 3$. This is also problematic for performing a Pareto front \cite{Pareto_Deriv,Pareto_LJPQ,Pareto_ST} or feasible region \cite{Mess4} analysis that typically require a very refined grid of the parameter space. Furthermore, Bayesian methods that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the parameter space become extremely expensive in higher dimensions when direct simulations are required at each step \cite{Bay_UQ,Bay_Deriv,Bay_MD}. 
%%% This may not be true. Higher dimensional optimizations actually are less likely to get trapped, apparently.
%A common problem for any high dimensional parameter space is that gradient based optimizations can get trapped in local minima while so-called global optimizations may require inordinate number of ``function evaluations'' (i.e. molecular simulations). Increasing the number of parameters can also lead to a high degree of parameter correlation. In addition, over-parameterization can result in non-physical optimal parameters which will likely extrapolate poorly. For these reasons, it is common to make model simplifications by reducing the number of parameters in a judicious manner. There are four primary ways to accomplish this: 1) optimizing the intramolecular contribution independent of the intermolecular potential 2) constraining parameters in the non-bonded potential 3) employing combining rules and 4) transferring parameters for similar site types. Unfortunately, each of these model simplifications can lead to model deficiencies.
%
%Typically, intramolecular potentials are obtained by regressing model parameters to match quantum mechanical calculations of different configurations. Subsequently, the intermolecular (non-bonded) potentials are often fit to reproduce experimental data, such as saturated liquid density, vapor pressure, and heat of vaporization. It is commonly assumed that the uncertainty propagated from the intramolecular potential to the vapor-liquid equilibria properties $(\rho_{\rm l}^{\rm sat}, \rho_{\rm v}^{\rm sat}, P_{\rm v}^{\rm sat})$ is negligible relative to the uncertainty caused by the non-bonded potential \cite{Intra_Potoff,Mess4}. Therefore, recent studies that have reported high accuracy force fields have focused primarily on the non-bonded potential (with the main exception being the focus given to anisotropic-united-atoms for terminal sites). For this reason, the present study focuses on parameterizing the non-bonded potential. 
%
%Although the generalized $\lambda_{\rm rep}$--$\lambda_{disp}$ Mie potential (where $\lambda_{\rm rep}$ is the repulsive exponent and $\lambda_{disp}$ is the dispersive exponent) can use any floating point value for $\lambda_{\rm rep}$ and $\lambda_{disp}$, the common practice is to set $\lambda_{disp}=6$. The dispersive tail having an $r^{-6}$ dependence is well founded and should thus lead to improved extrapolation \cite{Mie}. In addition, it is common to only consider integer values of $\lambda_{\rm rep}$ (and sometimes only even integers). This has a nice computational advantage since it is much less expensive to compute a number raised to an integer power than a floating point power \cite{Mie}. Furthermore, this simplifies the optimization to a set of two-dimensional parameter spaces (in $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$) rather than a single three-dimensional parameter space (in $\epsilon, \sigma$, and $\lambda_{\rm rep}$). Unfortunately, this assumption reduces the model flexibility which may lead to inadequate representation of the target variables \cite{Avendano2013}. For example, Papaioannou et al. demonstrated that in many cases the optimal repulsive exponent $(\lambda_{\rm rep})$ is not an integer value \cite{Papaioannou2016}.
%
%Another way to reduce the number of model parameters is by implementing Lorentz-Berthelot (or some other form of) combining rules for cross-interactions. Cross-interaction parameters are the non-bonded parameters for two different site types. Combining rules reduce the number of fitting parameters from being $O(n_i^2)$ to $O(n_i)$, where $n_i$ is the number of site types. In addition, combining rules are intended to ensure that cross-interaction parameters are physically reasonable. That being said, the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules have been called into question, especially for mixtures \cite{Delhommelle2001}. For this reason, many other \textit{ad hoc} combining rules have been proposed \cite{TraPPEUA2}.
%
%Finally, transferability is an essential assumption in molecular simulation. Transferability assumes that the non-bonded interactions are the same when two chemical moieties are in a similar environment, e.g. the CH$_2$ groups in \textit{n}-butane are the same as the CH$_2$ groups in \textit{n}-pentane. The assumption of transferability has been fundamental to force field development as it allows for a systematic sequential parameterization of functional groups. With this assumption a new chemical moiety is included in the force field by assuming all previous parameters are constant. Therefore, parameterizing the n$^{th}$ site type has the same cost as the first. Unfortunately, validation of transferability is an essential but difficult (and typically omitted) step. 
%
%The primary reason for this is that if two sites are found to not be transferable it may require significant reparameterization of previously optimized site types. For example, the improved TraPPE-UA2 CH$_3$ LJ parameters will likely necessitate reparameterization of other site types from the TraPPE-UA force field that were optimized using the previous TraPPE-UA CH$_3$ LJ parameters. This is an arduous and time-consuming process.
%
%Although the aforementioned simplifications can dramatically reduce the number of fitting parameters, it is not clear \textit{a priori} if these assumptions lead to model inadequacies. In fact, it is almost certain that they do. Ideally, it would be possible to optimize a force field to a large number of data and compounds simultaneously (rather than sequentially) and use rigorous statistical methods to select the optimal non-bonded potentials, validate combining rules, and determine when two sites are in fact transferable. This would require advanced high dimensional optimization routines such as genetic algorithms, leapfrog \cite{RHINEHART2012}, or Bayesian optimizers (see Ucyigitler et al. \cite{SPEADMD}). Unfortunately, these methods are not feasible when molecular simulations are performed at each step of the optimization algorithm. By contrast, Papaioannou et al. and Elliott et al. demonstrated how large amounts of compounds and data can be optimized simultaneously when using less expensive approaches, namely, the SAFT-$\gamma$ equation-of-state and SPEADMD, respectively \cite{Papaioannou2016,SPEADMD}. These methods allowed the authors to determine when additional parameters were needed to distinguish between site types and when two site types were considered indistinguishable.

%% SPEADMD is probably best classified as a configuration sampling based surrogate model
